Shall we dance?
Or maybe just limp around?
These feet are cold and beat,
And strangers to the ground.
The sound of the kick is arousing.
The couples are sweet in their love.
Tonight, we'll stagger up from the basement
Or fall to our deaths from above.
You've got those moves and those eyes
I've got these shakes and bad breath.

[Chorus:]
I've never tried that,
I've never tried that,
I've never tried that,
But I know I don't like it.
I've never tried that,
I've never tried that,
I've never tried that,
But I know I don't like it.
Or, maybe I do I'm just too weak to fight it. [x3]
Where are you? Where are you?
I hate to let 'em see me crying.

I'm gonna zip on my party suit and show y'all something:
There ain't no such thing as strumpin' for nothing
You can fly with us or hang on to the walls
But the devil's takin' names when the last curtain falls

I got a deep sick worry and I don't know why!
Where are you? where are you? what are you doing tonight?
Laughing and crying are almost the same
They just show everyone how much attention you're paying

[Chorus]

So dry them eyes
Everyone else went back inside
Laughing and crying are almost the same
They just show everyone how much attention you're paying

So dry them eyes
Everyone else went back inside
