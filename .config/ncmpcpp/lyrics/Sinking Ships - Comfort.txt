Is tomorrow really a new day or is it just the same, repackaged and renamed? I still feel the same. did I really ever make a change? am I cursed to comfort by the lies... I tell myself. I guess not as easy and counting every piece and numering every line and telling yourself everything will be all right. when sleep fades with the memories of fonder times for you to believe this one, I can't expect you to cut loose every noose I wrap around myself. I feel the floor dropping out, just let me swing myself to sleep. leave me in the darkness, leave me to my peace.
