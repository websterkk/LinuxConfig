Like a chameleon
You're just crawling on
Changing color again and again

You do the things you like
Don't care if you're alike
Anyone of your friends

You focus on the things that you cherish
And you reinvent yourself over time
Haven't seen mountains too high for you to climb
Everything you are now will perish
Who you are today will later be gone
Your need to be free and change your colors is mighty strong
Like a chameleon

You cannot please them all
You won't be no one's doll
So put their bull to the side

You always change your course
Got an elastic force
Man, you just let it ride

From pink to red to green to blue to black
Once you start there is no turning back
From punk to dad to brewer to schoolboy
Life's too short not to be enjoyed

You focus on the things that you cherish
Who you are today will later be gone
Everything you are now will perish
Like a chameleon
