Every time you blink, every time you drink
Every time you sleep, I'm alive and well
Every time you're weak.
In the corner of your eye, in the back of your mind, on the tip of your tongue.
In your anger you'll find.
Right on time, a destiny I designed.
I give you all that you need.
I'm your greed. I'm your pride.
You question all that is clear.
To ignore is to pay.
You beg for your life yet you give it away.
All the things that you thought you could always hide,
Well, now it seems they're right outside,
So I become and I beg to waste your time.
It's not a waste of mine, and I've been waiting a long fucking time.
Weakened by the disease called hate you'll come around, you'll share my fate.
Hands up in your face and brain.
You think we can't see them, you think I can't be them.
Well, give them to me.
I'll set you free from every worry and care
And all the things that you've lost you may have lost them to me but I never lied.
I told you one day you'd want this to stop.
Try to understand I could not forsee this.
Yes, you understood that in time you'd be this.
I beat you once. I'll defeat you again. You can't win.
This will never end. It's the end of the fall,
It's the end of your season as your senses fleet I become your reason.
At the bottom you can clear you head.
This same mistake I know I can't make again.
