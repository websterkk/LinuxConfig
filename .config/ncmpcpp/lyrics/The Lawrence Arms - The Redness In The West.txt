Wasting away, never felt this way before
I played all the ditties they were hollerin' for
Then they shot at my boots and told me to dance
And I didn't really want to, but before I had the chance

To say my piece, everyone was laughing in my face
Safe to say I hate this place

Do you want to get lost, 'cause I can't stay found
I've done my time killing days in this town
I got a little itch and I'm thirsty
All I want to know is who's coming with me

Fuck you, you're cool, fuck you too
The last goodbye is simple and true
I got a fever for the cowbell, boys
I fell for the beat but I stay down for the noise

Break into something that's beautiful now
Tell me that it's gonna be okay
Or exalt my friendships and line up these bottles of Beam from my crib to my grave
I wrote it to end it this way

Let's get lost 'cause I can't stay found
Hell, anywhere is fine if we drift out now
I'm so tired of doing my dying here
We'll fuck 'em all, we're gonna fuck 'em all when we get there

There, there, there, there
This time we're gonna roll where only fools dare
We're gonna lie, lie, lie, lie, lie tonight
Then we'll disappear
