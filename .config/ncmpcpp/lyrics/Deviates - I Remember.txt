When I think of my youth, I don't remember you, you weren't there
You didn't care, you still don't care, you never cared if I did, but I don't
It was a dream I had no choice, I couldn't scream I had no voice
To say or do anything, I was all alone and the hate did grow
And I remember what it's like to be different, a constant fight, ya, I remember
You couldn't see no you couldn't feel, wake up from the dream just to find its real, yeah I remember
My mind was full of hate, my heart was empty I couldn't take it
It was your choice to leave, I hated you, did you hate me?
A fight for custody, over me, a piece of property, just filled me w/ confusion
Empty thoughts, anger and illusions.
Do you remember me, that whining kid, that crying baby
The hate has evolved, problem solved, you don't exist, it's all your fault
Yeah I remember what it's like to be a kid, that's not my life
You're nothing to me, you never were, that's pretty lame
I guess that's just the way it goes... but I remember
