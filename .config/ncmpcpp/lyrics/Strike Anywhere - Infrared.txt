Are we running so far from facing the numbers who
Clash in an empty room?
For false visions we search and the reflections consume
But the mirror is everyone's tomb

What we'll find in the waste of time
All these self-hating days in the image maze
Losing sight of our roots in the empty shells
Where everyone fights themselves

Everyone fights themselves
We're tired of looking out from blank eyes

I get so tired of waiting, tired of waiting
Outside, until it comes right in the window
Blank eyes, I get so tired of waiting, tired of waiting
Outside, another answer for our crimes

And I get so tired of waiting for it
To find the truth in everything rejected
I get so tired of waiting, tired of waiting
Another day between the lines

Rooftop to rooftop, screaming out into the sky
We fight the war inside us, turning answers into questions
Through all this vanity we'll fight until soul rebuild
Fools gold, what we've had, the symptoms of a world gone mad

The world's lies, the masses cry
Children's lives spent sewing up our cheap disguise
Losing sight of out roots in the cathode rays
Amnesia for the end of our days

Amnesia for the end of our days
We're tired of looking out from blank eyes

I get so tired of waiting, tired of waiting
Outside, until it's nothing special
Blank eyes, I get so tired of waiting, tired of waiting
Outside, another answer for our crimes

And I get so tired of waiting for it
To find the truth in everything rejected
I get so tired of waiting, tired of waiting
Another day between the lines

We're all gone dead, what we reject
All gone dead, what we reject
All gone dead, what we reject
Wake up everyone

Blank eyes, tired of waiting
Outside, here I am
Blank eyes, tired of waiting, tired of wasting all away
Outside, here I am
