Parting with comfort again 
A still frame image of their union 
The eyes were turning black 
Her face had grown so deathly cold 

Into the dark 
Into this place where they were young 
Into the dark 
Where fear and love had just begun 

The clouds taking different paths 
A blessing in the skies or a relapse? 
The rains have left tonight 
Solace in the face of decent 

Into the dark 
Into this place where they were young 
Into the dark 
Where fear and love had just begun 

He always knew they'd find him 
And that there was no hiding 
He spends his whole life hiding 
He spends his whole life hiding 
He spent his whole life hiding 

Into the dark 
Into this place where they were young 
Into the dark 
Where fear and love had just begun 
Into the dark 
Into this place where they were young 
Into the dark 
Where fear and love 
Had just begun
