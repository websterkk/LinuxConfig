Hello, old friend
It's been a while, how you been?
All things must end
But did you know what that meant?

The birds fly south
The summer sets, the lights go out
Leaves on the ground
Autumn walker, you just walked out

And I see it now
That it's so much easier alone
And you don't have to worry about me
It's all good, it's all wrong

And I hope you find the place
And the people that you need
I don't want to be the one who always waits
For you to wait and see

What makes you run?
Was it me or anyone?
It goes to show
When people grow, people go

And there you go
Autumn walker
Stay now
Autumn walker

Drink down your doubt
A glass half empty can empty you out
My heart is full
Of promises that drank me whole

And I see it now
That it's so much easier alone
But you don't have to go that far
'Cause wherever you go, there you are

And it shouldn't be so hard
To see your friends, that's who they are
I don't mean to tell you how to run your life
But make up your heart

You go too far
In the atmosphere you fall apart
More miles than my car's got on it
That's pretty far
