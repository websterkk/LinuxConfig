Phone it in again, another in bank, I'm spoiled by the riches
I had a line to remember and I wrote it in the sand
Tried to go get it but the tide swooned

We are the lucky ones, we ain't got it so bad
Baby, you go all in, sometimes you win
You bet

[Hook]
We are the noise makers, the modern wayfarers
Here be no guts, no glory
There be no guts, no glory
Tell me why'd I wait so long to break these chains around me

We share without knowing, screams soaring in every direction
We sweat like boat builders and marvel at our work
Smiling at the imperfections

We are the lucky ones, we ain't got it so bad
Baby, you go all in, sometimes you win
We will get up to get down
Keep the faith, sing loud

[Hook]
Why'd I wait so long to break these chains

[Bridge]
Give them our regards out there
Tell them we'll be back again
New Bedford, bury me somewhere near you

Smiling at the imperfections as they disappear over the horizon
From Rain City to Gainesville we ran
Then back to Melville again
With whiskey-soaked tales, half-forgotten
Still in the bottle at the bottom

Tell me why'd I wait so long to break these chains around me
Why'd I wait so long to take the reins of my life
Why'd I wait so long to break these chains
Why'd I wait so long to take the reins

[Hook]

I've been guilty, I know it, believe me
I admit, I've been bored, I've been lazy
Down and out on Cherokee Street

[Bridge]
