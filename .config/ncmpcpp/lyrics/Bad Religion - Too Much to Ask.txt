A refreshing plunge, a drink of palatable water
A deep inspiration on a warm summer day
A safe stroll in the middle of a road community
A neighbor who in times of need will not turn away

I ain't no politician
I am a citizen
And I wonder if I'm living too far out of bounds

Community protection, rehabilitation
Police that serve without legitimate right to maim
Global awareness, ecological guilt
Cultural and environmental awakening

I ain't no optimist
I try to be a realist
I wonder if I'm thinking too far out of bounds

Is it too much to ask?
Could it be the earth is shrinking?
I can see the walls closing in
No one can take much for granted anymore

Remote control, three cars for every family
Corruption at the expense of the simple majority
A violent crash, a plunder of the third world
Any wretched plot that bolsters our economy

I ain't no blind supporter
I'm a conscious citizen
And I know that we are living too far out of bounds

I ain't no politician
I ain't no blind supporter
I ain't no metropia, I am a citizen
And wonder if I'm living too far out of bounds

Is it too much to ask?
Can we keep the earth from sinking?
I can see the walls closing in
No one can take much for granted anymore

You better not take it for granted anymore
I'm not taking nothing for granted anymore
