So here we go

An international war
We're buying the voice to lie and justify the score
Fight the confusion, anger, and hate
Our shot in the darkness, it's never too late

One will and one heart, a worldwide calling out
To your muted voices, we scream and shout
Our leaders invoke their gods and their eyes glaze
Profits and prophets, religions of guilt and decay

Will we fall, we will fight?
Blackout in the daylight in world justice's name
Will we fall, will we fight?
Blackout in the work yards of the killing game

Blackout, I don't wanna fight
Blackout, against our rights
Blackout, won't take the life
The spoils of war we'll profit from no more

Blackout, don't wanna fight
Blackout, won't take the life
Blackout, won't take the life

There are no saints, there are no patriots
Designer gods fulfill their prophecy
But they're not talking to me
While crocodile tears pour from the TV

Well, you were once boardroom tables apart
While trading our reason for the businessman's art
How many fabricated enemies
Will it take until we see?

Will we fall, we will fight?
Blackout in the daylight in world justice's name
Will we fall, will we fight?
Blackout in the work yards of the killing game

Blackout, I don't wanna fight
Blackout, against our rights
Blackout, won't take the life
The spoils of war we'll profit from no more

Blackout, don't wanna fight
Blackout, won't take the life
Blackout, against our rights
Here we go

Here we go

There are no saints, there no patriots
Designer gods fulfill their prophecies
But they're not talking to me
How many false enemies will it take until we see?

Will we fall, will we fight?
Blackout in the daylight
Will we fall, will we fight?
Blackout in the daylight
