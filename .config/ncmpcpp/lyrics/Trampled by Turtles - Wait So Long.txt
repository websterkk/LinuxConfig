I could never pretend that I don't love you.
You could never pretend that I'm your man.
That's exactly the way that I want it.
That's exactly the way that I am.

And you call me in the morning with your troubles
Takin' it downtown every night
I could never place the stars at night above ya.
I got my hands on the ground,
and you know I'm right.

You wait so long,
You wait so long,
You wait so long,
You wait so long.

It's a coffee stained earth ever time it happens.
Liven up honey it ain't that bad.
Any afterthought rose to recognition
Like every other coffin that I had

And your buick broke down in Winnemucca,
Fall to your knees and you pray to the lord
Then you take up hope at the politicians:
Nothing happens in this burnt out town anymore.

You wait so long,
You wait so long,
You wait so long,
You wait so long.

And your heart rolls on like a frozen freight train
You know that I help you if I can
But I'm just a raindrop in a river
Just a little itty-bitty grain of sand

And you know that I'm doomed to repeat this
With all the bad habits that I've learned
But it's better than your fire-borne fornication
And all the dirty money that you earn.

You wait so long,
You wait so long,
You wait so long,
You wait so long.
