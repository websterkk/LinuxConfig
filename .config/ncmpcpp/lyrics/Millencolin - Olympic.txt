Could it be I'm a lonely one
that made everything so upsidedown now
could it be all the lies I told that gave
nightmares to me after an olympic day
you said everything was fine
but I saw you through
and I knew that I was just as bad as you.

Never said I would give you up
but if I must then tell me why now
never said I believed in all those things I've heard
about you from those rumours now
I thought everything was fine
but you proved me wrong
and I was taken by surprise.

Don't like me, don't like me,
don't you know I'm good for nothing,
don't like me, was what you told me when I called you up.
Don't like me, don't like me,
don't you know I'm good for nothing,
don't like me, whatever I may say to make you feel that way.

Could it be I'm a lonely one
that turned everything so upside down now
could it be that you told me that you still loved me that
made me change so quickly now
I heard me when you called.

Don't like me, don't like me,
don't you know I'm good for nothing,
don't like me, was what I told you when you called me up,
don't like me, don't like me,
don't you know I'm good for nothing,
don't like me, eventhough inside I know I want you to
didn't want to tell you what to do.
