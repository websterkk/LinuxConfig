Invisible, inviting visions linger
The swirl of smoke looks like her slender body
I see everything in frames now
Golden, gilded, rippled edges wave goodnight

Light sleeper, what's keeping you from waking?
The shallow stare has said it all

Cold dark face reminds me of the night we learned to smoke
Fireflies at our lips
37 years until I show my face again
Steal this moment, make it worth saving

Light sleeper, what's keeping you from waking?
The shallow stare has said it all

Choke down the clouds that cloud your head now
It would make my gloomy day
Where ever you are, you've stayed far away for too long

The clocks are flipping on their backs
Don't stay too late, I'll fizzle and fade
A statue of stoned beliefs, a monument
To monumental dying thoughts

Let the currents take us where they will
From this hill I can see a world unfold before me
I'm brooding on the broken nights
I break each sentence like a limb, like a limb

This is my exit
I storm out stage left
It'll feel like I left you
So long ago

These arms will bleed, I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting with wishful elation
Light sleeper, you could make my gloomy day
Make this moment worth saving
