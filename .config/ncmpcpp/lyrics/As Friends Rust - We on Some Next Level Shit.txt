What we've got is an amalgam of spent ideals
An incomprehensible mismatch of spent ideals
Self-congratulatory edicts spit from gold-plated mouths
That will never understand what it means to miss a meal
Don't tell me what I need until you've needed anything
Private-school anarchists with bought trains of thought
Donned in T-shirts screaming slogans of wars never fought
And I'm supposed to hide my change?
For who and for what?
To appease the piss-ants pretending their haves are have-nots?
I know what you came out here for
