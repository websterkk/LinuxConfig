I wonder what the best thing is
To have a face or to have charm?
Well, my girl's twofaced and she's a fartalarm
I'm not blind and I do have nose
But I don't wanna use it now
I rather try to follow my heart this time
Good looks, it makes me nervous
I need someone who's not perfect

It's you, you're overweight and lovely
Yes, it's true, a pig in walking shoes
You drool every time we kiss, I must say you rule
I'm falling in love with you

I know that all those trendy girls
Would leave me when I'm broke
And also be disgusted when I smoke, no joke
I don't want no model
Unless she has a major body

Just an ounce of human touch, I realize it's a killercrush
I'm dancing, I'm overjoyed
I took a chance on you 'cause I wanted some romance
To and now I'm happy as can be
Cause this supersized woman means all to me
