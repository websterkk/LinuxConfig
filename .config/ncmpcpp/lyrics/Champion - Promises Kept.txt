Alone in a crowd, but we're still standing strong 
With X'ed up fists and sing alongs
Times like these are what we live for 
These days are more than we'd ever hoped for

We're still here, and we'll never forget the words we said
Time flies by, and the promises made will stay with us
Through our lives

We're not finished yet, that's right

They tried to break the best of us 
But still our hearts are true to promises kept
