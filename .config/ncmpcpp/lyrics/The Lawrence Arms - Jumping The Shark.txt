Losing's sort of a pastime
The years fly right by with the drinks
It's morning in this small apartment
And I just threw up in the sink

The coffee's not settling anything
And I'm as tired as I've ever been
I'd like to go back to Chicago
But I'm not looking back there again

I've fought with all of my teachers
I've fought with all of my friends
I've found with the vices and sweating and shakes
I'm not going back there again
No, I'm not going back there again

Tonight, tonight I'm walking away
Tonight, tonight I'm walking away
I don't want to hear about old days
What are we doing today?
Fake memories, they don't impress me
The old times were never that great

We got the whole city before us
Tonight, tonight I'm walking away
And I want to bury the past
Tonight, tonight I'm walking away
With bottles and dancing, whiskey and love
Let's drink to the death of regret, of regret, of regret, of regret

Tonight, tonight I'm walking away
Tonight, tonight I'm walking away
