There was a time and a place 
That was all full of mistakes
And a face that was all full of shit
I was frustrated and angry

I was more than alive 
A catcher in the rye
I was a jet plane
I was a thin membrane

Washing and preening and shedding all hope
I am Hot Shots, Part Deux, I'm Down Periscope
The rope that I'm hanged from keeps telling me what to do
I'm pissing on the fires and learning a remarkable truth about you

Ugly is ugly
Transformation is a dream, a dream, a dream
So love what you are
Not what you would like to be

I'm a drunk with a job
I've got pictures to prove it
Got some junk in my trunk
And the dance moves to move it

I am written on the subway walls
I am bitter when I fall
I am written on the subway walls
I am bitter when I fall

Shout me in the streets and parks
Scrape your voices on the stars
Shout me in the streets and parks
Scrape your voices on the stars

I'm a man with a guitar, I am Three's Company
It's the end of the world, sit and watch with me
I'm a man with a guitar, I am Three's Company
It's the end of the world, sit and watch with me

"Good friend, how loud do
You want life to shout her
Answers in your ear?"
