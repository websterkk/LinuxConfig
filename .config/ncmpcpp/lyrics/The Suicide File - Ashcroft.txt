If what it boils down to is that "you're either for us or against us,"
I guess I've got a tough, tough choice to make.
'Cause hollow patriotic actions and re-enactments don't move me.
And mostly this 21st century brand of propaganda and rhetoric,
Co-produced by Disney, and sanatized by CGI.
Just makes me sick.
And when I peer through.
Through the red. Through the white.
And through the blue.
I can see people like you.
Using tragedy to to advance your own narrow moral crusade.
