Twenty one, feeling down
I tell you nothing with a thousand words and I
Weaker get with every step
I waste my time on compact disc's and stale fish
I can't remember the last time I did something
That made me feel all right for longer than a few hours
If I only had the strength to make some muffins
Then I swear that I would share them with you now

Am I odd or am I not?
That's the question I spend time analyzing
I'm so soft but still I'm not
Living up to what people want me to be
'Cause I'm busy with me, myself and I can't
Be understood by someone I don't know to well
So I'm shutting out the whole world just to play Nintendo
I've got these new games but I'm afraid you can't join me

These last few years I've been struggling
And I'm tired of keeping a low profile
So now it's time to show that I'm alive
I'm gonna change my life
Change my plans
Change my Vans
Even start to dance now
Change my thoughts
Change my sox
Change my moves
Even change my pro fighter Q for you

No it's not for you
And change mine just for me,
Change mine just for me
