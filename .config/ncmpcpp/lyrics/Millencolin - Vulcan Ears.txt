In a tiny spaceship
With four legs a pillow and some sheets
That's where my idols always meet
I'd like to be there now

Trying trying every night to see a UFO
But in case I don't, just in case I won't
I've got my fantasy to lean on

Vulcan eyebrows, vulcan ears
That's what I dream of
No more sorrow, no more tears
Can't you get me beamed up?
Vulcan logic, vulcan needs
Quite bizarre but still a dream
As I'm waiting for that beam

Bullshit is all we talk on this planet we call earth
Since I'm tired of that I'll take a further step
I think I'll find my way in space

In a tiny spaceship
With four legs a pillow and some sheets
That's where my idols always meet
I'd like to be there now
