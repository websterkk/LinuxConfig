Since I had broken away that night
To keep myself from human sight
I face dark skies when I take my turn
The time has come for me to strike again
That time I was given a prison to live
With happiness and joy supposed to receive
But torture and suffering were only to find
They set an ultimate goal to destroy my mind

Breakout (Breakout)
From this cage I'm trapped inside
Run away
There's no place in hell to hide
No more held down
In that house of doom

And as I was running that road of disgrace
My heart was pumping cause they found my trace
although I was chased, they lost my trail
I swore in my life it's my time to prevail
And so I will wander until I am done
I'm shattered, I'm broken my faith isn't gone
It seems I am damned to live a fugitive life
I'll head down to my fate with a blood stained knife

Breakout (Breakout)
From this cage I'm trapped inside
Run away
There's no place in hell to hide
No more held down
In that house of doom

Breakooout!
There's no place in hell to hide!!!
