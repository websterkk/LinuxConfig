The surging blood rushes through me
In tune to the pulsing in my head
The message echoes over and over
What are you doing with your time?

I'm a piece of shit and tonight
My heart is reaching for the sky
I stand there and it just pumps harder and slower
My feet settle into earth

The twilight feels right
The shadows fade along the avenue

They talk all the time and it's obvious
That I hold in my words for too long
Our history creeps fast through the gutters.
A revolution on my mind

Guess what, I give a shit
But I couldn't care less about the lives they chose to live
And your eyes speak to me deeper and deeper
A truth that I have never known

The twilight feels right
The shadows fade into oblivion

So just forget all the regrets that keep haunting you
They aren't worth your time
And just forget all the days that dragged on for miles and miles
Leave them all behind, leave them all behind
