[Hook - Takeoff:]
Trendsetters, go-getters, drug dealers
Dope dealers, all my niggas
Can’t leave that house without your pistol then I fucks with you
Pimp niggas, can’t forget about my rich niggas
Bad bitches independent that don’t need a nigga
Ain’t got no flaws, pause, bitch look like a model picture
Ball, we gon’ buy it all, hit the mall with you
This for them niggas and them bitches been through pain with you
Get the picture?

[Verse 1 - Takeoff:]
Trap niggas trap in the trenches
They been fingerprinted, they all in the system
Rest in peace Sandra Bland and Michael Brown
I pray I don’t become a victim
Rest in peace Pistol Pete, nigga I miss you
Smoking that OG gas bag in a swisher
Drinking on codeine, don’t fuck with that Henny
And it’s 7% alcohol in it
Free West Side, he doing five
That’s a sentence, time ticket
Want my niggas to be free so they can just see how we living
That boy Freaky, he be geekin’ on them Xans, trigger itching
Look like Kim Possible from Disney, I send him on a mission
Niggas throw salt on your pimping, they can’t wait to catch you slipping
Tripping, burnt out niggas [?], don’t know what these niggas sipping
Trapping that contraband, never run out of narcotics
Drug dealer that is my nigga
Asian persuasion, caucasian, black, white, and Jamaican
I never discriminate races

[Verse 2 - Offset:]
Got a bitch up in the kitchen whipping up Diana
Got a banana, black bandana hang off the handle
Trapping the Porsche, hit the panel
Stuffing the dope in the camel
My niggas is too hot to handle
This is a real nigga anthem
Bad bitches, independent, on her business
I pull up in the phantom and I got ten models with me
Plus ten choppers with me
Sipping on drink, my doctor with me
Fuck that ho in a drop top Bentley
Too many shooters so you cannot get me
Hop in the foreign, and jump out the Bentley
These bitches sucking on dick so don’t kiss me
Ain’t talking money so dismiss me
Your bitch keep telling me she miss me
She eat up the molly like Nestlé
Call me sir when you address me
Don’t let the money get the best of me
Can’t let these niggas get the recipe

[Verse 3 - Quavo:]
Ball players, trap niggas, trendsetters
Gang members, we the same niggas
Thick women, little bitty women
Big mama, little mama, y’all the same sister
I been on my grind, I beat the odds
I know that I tried at least a thousand times
My grandmama died, she stay on my mind
At least I let her see me at the top and I made her smile
I keep it real for my niggas, got love for my niggas
Remember them days, we kicking in doors, came up off of pistols
And it’s so sad niggas in your hood hating on you
But it’s all good, you got niggas cocked and aimed on ‘em
