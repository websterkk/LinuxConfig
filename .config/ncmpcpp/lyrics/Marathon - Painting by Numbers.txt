Let's start a war
Let's start a war
What the hell do you think all these new bombs are for?

I'm feeling generous today
And I'm itching to make a charity donation
There are some orphan bombs who only want to do their jobs
And need a place to detonate

Let's start a war
And give a home to these explosions
Let's start a war

I could say that I'm not smashing piggy banks for all this killing
But I'll just turn away and bathe in the stream 
Of shopping bags and half-price tags and giveaways

We hold the purse, we hold the reins
We can deny these spoiled kids their next allowance
When they start shoving 'round like bullies on the playground
We shake our pockets for more change 

Let's start a war
'Cause I'm a sucker for a good fight
Let's start a war

Will we say that we're not buying any toys for naughty children
No we'll just turn away and pass the buck off 
To the governments who kill off all the dissidents 
And let our culpability dissolve out in the acid rain

So everyone grab your nuclear brush
And your palette of industrial sludge
And paint a sunrise so dark it will never return

Please stop acting like this comes from somebody else
'Cause we've commissioned this painting ourselves
So just sit back and relax and scatter limbs like Picasso, spatter blood like Pollack

Art critics are standing by
To declare this a wonderful sight
Lock and load all your checkbooks we'll fill this gallery

It's such a classic tapestry 
Full of weapons and violence and need
We will hang it in the finest museums of history
