For too long I've played it safe
Did everything that you wanted me to do for you
I held my tongue closed my eyes
Did everything that a good boy supposed to do but i

In the blur of right and wrong
I found a voice that describes you the best
Mightier than one thousand swords
It calms the storm it creates and reshapes my face.

My disclaimer.
To say what I want I need to find a word that doesn't exist.
I can be a master or a slave,
Wear one thousand different faces you'd never resist.
Tell me to say what I want to and then you pin it on me.
Expected to pay for what I can't do.
Then you tell me it's free but that I'll never be.

Maybe I made a mistake saying everything I wanted to.
You've got your finger pointed straight at me.
I hop you hear these words because I'm talking to you,
And I wasted my time, my breath, and everything that I gave to you.
Freedoms fulfilled take their toll.
Show me the one and only word that describes you,

Tell me to say what I want to and then you pin it on me.
Expected to pay for what I can't do.
Then you tell me it's free but that I'll never be.

You're quick to judge;
I'm serving my sentence.
Every word I write is evidence.
Forgive me for my honesty.
I can't learn to choke on these words and I won't,
Then you pin it on me.

Disclaimer. I'll say what I want
Complaint, you add your name to the list.
If I can find the words you will,
I've got nothing to hide and no one to impress.

Tell me to say what I want to and then you pin it on me.
Expected to pay for what I can't do.
Then you tell me it's free but that I'll never be.

You're quick to judge;
I'm serving my sentence.
Every word I write is evidence.
Forgive me for my honesty.
I can't learn to choke on these words and I won't,
Then you pin it on me.
