I was awake, dreaming about sleeping
And my mistakes and how I keep 'em
So close to me, so that I'll never, never forget
I can't get anywhere

Shedding tears over these bottles
Celebrating my life at the bottom
Of the barrel of a barrel so rotten
And I've forgotten what this like before I started stopping

Fuck this, fuck this, I'm out, I'm out
Of bullshit to cry about
You can pass these fuck you's around
I'll be dead and gone when this shit hits the ground

Tell me why, why, why, why, why
I even tried, tried, tried tonight
I should just let it die
'Cause I'm so tired of waiting for this shit to shine

I was asleep, dreaming about palm trees
Then I woke up to lonely city streets
I heard the voices echoed in the back rooms
And I had to run around the corner to the barstools

Where I was shedding tears over these bottles
Celebrating my life at the bottom
Of the barrel of a barrel so rotten
And I've forgotten

How to light this fire
I've forgotten how to tow this wire
I've forgotten
What this was like before I started stopping

Tell me why, why, why, why, why
Do I even try, try, try tonight?
I should probably let it die
And I'm tired of waiting for this shit to shine

I am tired of waiting
I am tired of waiting
This is my life, this is my time
It's time to take it

This is my life, this is my time
This is my life, this is my time
This is my life, this is my time
Time, time, time, time, time
