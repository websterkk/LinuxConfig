I'm wasted as my time, spent sitting idly by
Drinking in this shithole while you all went out outside
It's a great day to fall asleep, it's a kick-ass day to dream
That I'm still capable of saying what I mean

The times are changing but we all stayed the same
We faded and faded, now nothing remains
As we breathe our last breaths and kiss our goodbyes
Remember us buried alive

I'm wasted as these city blocks
These Blockbusters and parking lots
As faded as a parking space
Sealed up to see what rots

The times are changing but we all stayed the same
We faded and faded, now nothing remains
Hold on, this ship is sinking and I don't know what to do
If we die in fire and water, then I want to be with you

Oh captain, my captain, I fought hard
Till everything was lost, no fortune did I seek
Remember, remember, remember us buried in the deep
Remember, remember, remember us buried in the deep
