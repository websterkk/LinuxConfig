I met a stranger he had fire in his eyes
Then I met a pretty angel but she was like too dead inside
Then I met a bunch of children with no food to eat or no place to hide
So I tried to get away now but there's nothing in the world that can keep me in the skies

So if you ever happen to bump into to god
Please ask him if he made this all up for fun
Come on

Don't keep it waiting you've got nothing to lose
The world is fading you've got nothing to prove
Finally it all comes crashing down to the earth
Finally we get what we deserve

I met a preacher, he had heart but he was blind
Then I met another homeless who sold his soul for less than a dime
So I opened up the papers but there were rats and painted lies
So I looked up to the sky and I smiled and realized how small we are

Yeah, so if you ever happen to bump into to god
Please ask him if he made this all up for fun
Come on

Don't keep me waiting you've got nothing to lose
The world is fading you've got nothing to prove
Finally it all comes crashing down to the earth
Finally we get what we deserve

Get what we deserve
We get what we deserve

Yeah

Pardon my french
This is so ridiculous
I'm a product of God
Still there's poison in my blood
I find it cynical
How things are critical
We better breakout
Before we blackout

Raise your voice
Don't let them break you down
All depends on what you do
It's a state of mind
Free the youth
Don't let them break you down
All depends on what you do
It's a state of mind

This boxing ring ain't big enough
For the two of us so hold your ground
One wrong move and you'll taste the ground
Taste the ground, yeah

Oh oh
We are the new generation
Oh oh
We have to rebuild the nation
Oh oh
We are the new generation
Oh oh
We have to rebuild the nation
Finally, finally, finally
We get what we deserve
