Get this through your pretty skull:
You were simply entertainment.
Worthless conversation,
A more worthless conversation piece.
Always find that way to win (diet pills and whisky swills).
Forever on the up-on-in.
In fact you're out of everything but "in".
You're gonna bore yourself to death.
Hey, you're in your way.
When you walk, when you talk... you're in your way.
And that "being yourself" thing ain't working out for you.
You're better off somebody else.
You're in your way.
You're gonna bare yourself to death.
