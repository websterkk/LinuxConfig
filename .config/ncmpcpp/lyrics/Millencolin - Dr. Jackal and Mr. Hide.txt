On your knees cause you're not wanted, your life is a
chaos and you wonder will it ever end, and all these
feelings they're not real, keep you down just the way it's
planned out today, today you've lost your way.

People grin, behind your back they are talking, they are
say you're doing it the wrong way once again
all these relations you belived in seem to brake up and it
drives you crazy.

Anyday you'll feel ok, your shoes will get you anywhere
just be patient cause soon you'll have your fun.

Staying in, hide away from problems, imagination's
playing games with you again, it's no illusion, it's just
confusion, but when the fog's gone you'll come out
strong, there's no time to be feeling down.
