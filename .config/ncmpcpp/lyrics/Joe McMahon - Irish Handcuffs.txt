We struggle to remember, we struggle to forget.
No strangers to addiction, we're just drowning the pain.
Good times with good friends, good fights with enemies.
We struggle to remember, but we can't forget.

Every week it was a party back in those days.
It didn't seem to matter that we were underage.
And the days go by, the days go by, the days go by, and the days go...
Have a shot and wash it down with another drink.
It did more damage at the time than we all could see.
And the days go by, the days go by, the days go by, and the days go...

We struggle with surrender, we struggle with regret.
No strangers to opinions, just tired of the games.
Broke ties with good friends, broke bread with enemies.
We struggle to remember, but we can't forget.

7 days a week on tour I'm getting pissed.
I need someone to fill me in on the things I missed.
And the weeks go by, the weeks go by, the weeks go by, yeah the weeks go...
Have a shot and wash it down with another drink.
Dude, it's all that would help you sleep,
And the weeks go by, the weeks go by, the weeks go by, yeah the weeks go...

Young livers dying slowly.
Through reckless days we've come to accept that we're not dead yet.

Young livers dying slowly.
Through reckless days we've come to accept,
When becoming men remember this: some never live, some never die,
But we're all here tonight.

Not as many folks are out anymore to see.
At least at weddings and at funerals we share a drink.
And the years go by, the years go by, the years go by, yeah the years go...
Have a shot and wash it down with another drink.
To tell the truth this shit is starting to make me sick.
And the years go by, the years go by, the years go by, and the years go...
