A common goal and a plan of action,
A way of life where anything can happen.
Now try hard and state your position
Strong as a whole but hold on to the vision.
By trying we all can be grounded and focused.
The opposition is dying and we can see to keep the faith is not just a choice
But fate and they've made their choice,
Now it's up to you and me, how it has to be.
I'll take this road till it ends.
One voice, one gal, no end.
Trusting is not innate in me.
Holding on to others used to bring me suffering.
Changing sparks a fear in me.
But I found faith in these three
And I know that we're finding everything we seek.
Working as one we've got the world to face,
But we're fine and we've agreed to be grounded
And focused holding on to our vision.
Separate all things that persuade our judgement or cloud our vision.
I'll take this road till it ends
One voice, one goal, no end.
