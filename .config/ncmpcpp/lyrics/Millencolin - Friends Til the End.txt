First words you say in tears, complaining how I'm never near
I know I'm lost sometimes cause I'm grounded in my mind
it's like this all the time, first I say you're OK then I go my way
and you're desperate, so desperate when you're down.

Here I stand, take my hand and I'll try to understand you right
the best way I can, cause after all I am your friend.

Last words you scream to me, you don't expect too much of me
cause I could give you anything if I just could be myself.
It's like that all the time, first I say that you're OK then I go my way again
you're so desperate but still mine.

But now the girl is working, now the girl feels fine and I'm the one who feels
down, but if she'll be working until the end of time
I hope she'll understand me then, the best way she can
cause after all I am her friend till the end.
