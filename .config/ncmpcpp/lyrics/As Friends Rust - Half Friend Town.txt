Here it is I hide
Independently confined to this half friend town
Prisoner where I reside
Cower from the Gainesville eye
Welcome to half friend town
And we all know what that means
It means giving up and selling out on all of our dreams
Here I think in song
Here I speak freely of my flaws (and my excesses)
I pray it won't be long
I pray I will move on
While the rest regress
Out-punk or punk out
Those are your only options here
