We returned to heaven to confront our resurrected horrors, they'd restlessly started a horrible revolt. 
So I smashed their thieving greedy blackened halos right back into broken zeros of digital hope, copper, and hurt. 
Say I won't. 
All your artists are just servants of the status quo. 
This darkness starves us, trademarks us miserable.

Come damage me. 
I descend into the cadence to unlock the city gates and retreat to my basement. 
Make the end come for me
