Where have I been all your life?
Sitting on fences, a novocaine for all the senses
Another year will pass us by
Making sense of nothing, in defense of something

I laughed too late
And dug myself into a grave

This year, I'll try to think too much
This year, I'll try to stand up for myself
This year, I'll live like I've never lived before
This is my year, for sure

Another stupid, clumsy story
More accidental aspirations
Another explosion of silence
I think I'm going deaf or maybe I'm just hearing less

This year, I'll try to only listen to myself

This year, I'll try to think too much
This year, I'll try to stand up for myself
This year, I'll live like I've never lived before
This is my year, for sure

I wonder where
You'll be bringing in the new year
As midnight clocks are singing
Good chance I'll be slobbering somewhere

Probably pass out wasted
And sleep until the smoke clears
Vague memories of midnight flash in tune to morning sunlight
I'll wake up knowing you'll never be there

I've got one hundred resolutions
But I've got no solutions
I've got one song I write a hundred times
And only a dozen or so rhymes

This year, I'll try not to drink so much
This year, I'll try to stand up straight
This year, let's live like we've never lived before
This is our year, for sure
