When did everything fall apart?
Now that you're moving on and we don't mean a thing
Can you tell me what it's like to turn your back
And just give in?
Because I can tell you exactly how it feels
How it feels to be left behind

The faces change and those days are gone for good
Memories are all that's left of what this meant to you
We need to see the past for what it is, and just move on 
These days were meant to be something we built with pride 

We can always remember the past
But we only get one shot at today
So leave regrets to yesterday

We know that the faces come and go
So we need to make this mean even more 
Every effort made to keep pushing on
Just a promise that we'll be here next year
