I think about you baby
And I can't breathe at all
(I) stall without you baby
An engine 'til I fall
And I fell so hard
This time

All you wanted was a man
That could help you baby
Help you baby
But I can't help at all
Though I tried
The best I can

Past my prime now daily
I have to sit and think
Turn out the lights and maybe
I'll have another drink
There's still a spark in your eyes

All you wanted was a man
That could help you baby
Help you baby
But I can't help at all
Though I tried
The best I can

Whispering winds come gently
And ease me to my feet
But there's blood in the air
And nice cars on the street
Just find a good place to hide

All you wanted was a man
That could help you baby
Help you baby
But I can't help at all
Though I tried
The best I can

I tried the best I can
I tried the best I can
