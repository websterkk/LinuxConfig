Unhinge all hearts with speed.
If you need something to believe,
We can bury them deep.
We'll put our faith in new machines.
Once we've exhausted all the oil and pornography
There will be so much to teach 
Of the slow math of debt and dreams

Yeah we deserve that much at least:
For every land a new war,
For every man a new disease.
Queue the years!
Hold our breaths to shallow beats.
We should storm the beach
And unhinge our lungs at least.

Unhinge all hearts asleep.
If you need something to believe,
New science always feeds us 
New bombs and new TV's.
And who here will say
The rate of pay for their working day
Is not outweighed by their fatigue?
The new math of debt and dreams.

Yeah we deserve that much at least:
For every land a new war,
For every man a new disease.
Queue the years!
Hold our breaths to shallow beats.
We should storm the beach
And unhinge our lungs at least.

Yeah for every land a new war,
For every man a new disease.
