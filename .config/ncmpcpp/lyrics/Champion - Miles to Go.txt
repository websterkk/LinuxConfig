When I fall I get right back up again and I walk it off
Because life's much too short to be held back by my mistakes
And when I struggle I try my best to find the lessons learned
They get me through and help me give my best

You're running from your problems and getting nowhere 
But you can't forget your dreams 
You'll never reach the goals you've set
Unless you try to take the risk
Can you take the chance?

You watched all your efforts get wiped away
And washed out with the tide
Don't let it kill the hope you feel inside
Let's get it straight you need to get back up and try again
Because sometimes the only path to take 
Is the hardest one to walk

Last shot at our mistakes, the time is now to set them straight
With miles to go will you take the risk?
The choice is yours, are you willing to take the chance?

With miles left to go, will you take the risk?
Because the only path to take is the hardest one to walk
