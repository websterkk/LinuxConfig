Headin' down south to the land of the pines
And I'm thumbin' my way into North Caroline
Starin' up the road
Pray to God I see headlights

I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Pickin' me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a hopin' for Raleigh
So I can see my baby tonight

So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey mama, rock me

Rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain
Rock me, mama, like a south-bound train
Hey mama, rock me

Runnin' from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old-time string-band
My baby plays the guitar
I pick a banjo now

Oh, the north country winters keep a gettin' me now
I lost my money playin' poker so I had to up and leave
But I ain't a turnin' back
To livin' that old life no more

So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey mama, rock me

Rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain
Rock me, mama, like a south-bound train
Hey mama, rock me

Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly, had a nice long toke
But he's a headed west from the Cumberland Gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee

And I gotta get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby callin' my name, and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh
At least I will die free

So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey mama, rock me

Rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain
Rock me, mama, like a south-bound train
Hey mama, rock me
