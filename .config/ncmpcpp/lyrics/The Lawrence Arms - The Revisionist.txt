The sway and swell
Fill you with her motion
Red gold across my arms
The vicious strokes I've painted

A river fills your heart
I'm sorry if I let you down

I know just how you feel tonight
This is never what you wanted
I've been searching for myself
In other peoples' eyes

The mirror's telling half truths
The stolen words finally feel like mine
Swollen and sweating, off-time
I can see it on your eyes

An ocean floods my heart
I'm sorry that I let you down

You know just how I feel tonight
This is everything I wanted
You've been searching for yourself
In other peoples' eyes

The revisionist never gets it perfect
Never gets it perfect
The revisionist never gets you perfect
Never gets you perfect

The time is never ripe
The words are never right
The time is never ripe
The words are never right
