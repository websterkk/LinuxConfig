Look how the ruts cling to my footsteps
The fatal invisible tool
By which we define, we fight for our approval
And fear our removal from the safety of fools

From the tidal forces of our positions
Not won, not one to take for granted
Are our rebel hymns incanted
To sing in the mines of the fortunate sons?

Brothers in spirit, sisters in rage
Will we live out our lives in this concrete cage?

Another heartbeat lost, another police murder
Buried in the public, eyes on the back page
Heartbeat lost in a new world order
Hobbled and bound but still walking away

I pledge allegiance to the world
Nothing more, nothing less than my humanity
I pledge allegiance to the world
Searching for vision, not invisibility

I pledge allegiance to the world
Searching for vision, not invisibility
I pledge allegiance to the world
Until the last lock breaks, none of us are free

None of us are free

We fight to balance our minds
Petty powers pushing profits over our lifetimes
World leaders mortgaging our lives with words
I don't need to be reminded of whom you really serve

Brothers in spirit, sisters in rage
Will we live out our lives in this concrete cage?

Another heartbeat lost, another police murder
Buried in the public, eyes on the back page
Heartbeats lost in a new world order
Standing alone with our backs to the maze

I pledge allegiance to the world
Nothing more, nothing less than my humanity
I pledge allegiance to the world
Until the last lock breaks, none of us are free

I pledge allegiance to the world
Until the last lock breaks, none of us are free
I pledge allegiance to the world
For nothing more, nothing less

In justice and hunger united
Searching for vision united
In justice and hunger united
Law and order, for whose orders?

I pledge allegiance to the world
Nothing more, nothing less than my humanity
I pledge allegiance to the world
Until the last lock breaks, none of us are free

I pledge allegiance to the world
Under no nation will we ever be
I pledge allegiance to the world
For nothing more, nothing less

Than my humanity
Than my humanity
Than my humanity
Pledge allegiance!

To our humanity
To our humanity
To our humanity
To the world
