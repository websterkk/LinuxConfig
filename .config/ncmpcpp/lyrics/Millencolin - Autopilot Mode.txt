I set the course and fly away
I'm not sure where I'm going
And I lack the time to care

It's a strategy they say
To keep myself from knowing
Too much about the world's despair

I don't use my brain so I won't go insane
I'm in autopilot mode
And to not lose my mind I would rather be blind
I'm a danger on the road

And I'm not the only one out there
In autopilot mode

Like a herd of elephants
It's hard to tell the difference
Between a brute and me

Is it fear or arrogance?
I just can't make any sense
Of this ruinous mystery

I don't use my brain so I won't go insane
I'm in autopilot mode
And to not lose my mind I would rather be blind
I'm a danger on the road

Like the def and the dumb I'm just marching on
I'm in autopilot mode

My survival instinct tells me not to think
Or my head else would explode
And I'm not the only one out there
In autopilot mode

C-3PO's no different than me
I've been well programmed by society to consume my identity
A rat racer who's never looking back, but likes the back seat
Where you never have to take responsibility, no

I don't use my brain so I won't go insane
I'm in autopilot mode
And to not lose my mind I would rather be blind
I'm a danger on the road

Like the def and the dumb I'm just marching on
I'm in autopilot mode

My survival instinct tells me not to think
Or my head else would explode
