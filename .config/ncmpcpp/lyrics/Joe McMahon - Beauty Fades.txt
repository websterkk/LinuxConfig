Beauty fades from this and every landscape that I've ever seen
Time slips by
And we all became memories
So instead of wasting time thinking of things I'd rather be
I'm untied
And this has left a hole in me

It always was my biggest fear to die without changing a god damn thing
We say the words, but do we understand
The difference between speaking and living them?
"I always was / I'll never be"
Is what we'd like to think, but the others see

Beauty fades from this and every landscape that I've ever seen
Time slips by
And we all became memories
So instead of wasting time thinking of things I'd rather be
I'm untied
And this has left a hole in me

And our lives begin to fade away
We look for something or someone to save us
Try to think of what you wanted to be
Before the fear of failing won you over
All the places that you wanted to see
Will remain in postcards and pictures
Til you die or finally take a chance
Say goodbye to all you've ever known

Say goodbye to all you've ever known

Say goodbye to all you've ever known

Say goodbye to all you've ever known

And our lives begin to fade away
We look for something or someone to save us
Try to think of what you wanted to be
Before the fear of failing won you over
All the places that you wanted to see
Will remain in postcards and pictures
Til you die or finally take a chance
Say goodbye to all you've ever known
Say goodbye to all you've ever known
Say goodbye to all you've ever known
Say goodbye to all you've ever known
Say goodbye to all you've ever known
