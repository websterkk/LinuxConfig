I hope you find what you've been looking for
Before I find my way to the door.
I hope your pride capsizes from the tears in your eyes
And drown in them like so many before.
I hope you change yourself for the better
And reach the potential we all know we saw.
I hope I dig my own grave with the things that I say.
Let my actions get my point across.
We're missing something significant in the dialogue,
It's not my problem. I choose to be reclusive amongst the sound.
It comes around when I need it most, it's mostly closer to me than anything,
Closer than you could ever be.
The antidote for everything.
I'd give anything to have everything turn out Okay.
I'd give half of every day to have the other half turn out
Half decently apart from all the mistakes we make to break away.
I'd give anything, whatever it takes.
In the wake of the way things will never be again,
It's too dark to read your face through hard times,
So here's my advice
Here's my advice!
Play the fastest record you can find,
Louder than your stereo will allow.
Hotwire your speakers, do whatever you have to.
Smash the mirrors in your house.
Go home and lock your bedroom door,
Don't open it for anything at all.
Live every word, scream every song,
These four chords could save your...
I'd give anything to have everything turn out Okay. PLAY IT LOUD!
I'd give half of every day to have the other half turn out PLAY IT LOUD!
Half decently apart from all the mistakes we make to break away. PLAY IT LOUD!
I'd give anything, whatever it takes.
I've lived my whole life like the only one listening.
It's so sad to say I didn't miss a single one of them
I've lived my whole life like the only one listening.
It's so sad to say I didn't miss a single one of them

Go home and lock your bedroom door,
Don't open it for anything at all.
Live every word, scream every song,
These four chords could save your life.
