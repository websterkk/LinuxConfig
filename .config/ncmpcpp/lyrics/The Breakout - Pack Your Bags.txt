Every year I feel the same
I hate the men and lose the game
Now I find myself on top
Nowhere to start, don't wanna stop

I love these lovely nights out on the club
Working late, it never stops
I'll be your electric shock
And with a song, I'll have your heart unlocked

If I'm on the radio, radio-o-o
Would you still love me so?
Or would you turn me off your stereo, stereo-o
Will you be at the show?
Screaming one last song tonight

Wake up kid, lets look for gold
This year's the year that I've been sold
I signed my name and sold my soul
I took the risk, don't wanna know

If I'm on the radio, radio-o-o
Would you still love me so?
Or would you turn me off your stereo, stereo-o
Will you be at the show?
Screaming one last song tonight [x2]

I wish I could live like this forever
And sing my days and days away

Armed with the choice beside me
I'm leaving this underground
And if I pack up my bags around me
Will you be filled with hate or struck with love?

If I'm on the radio, radio-o-o
Would you still love me so?
Or would you turn me off your stereo, stereo-o-
Will you be at the show?
Screaming one last song tonight
One last song tonight

Every year I feel the same
I hate the man and lose the game
Now I find myself on top
Nowhere to start, don't wanna stop
