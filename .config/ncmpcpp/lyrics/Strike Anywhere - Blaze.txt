We rise like lions after slumber
In un-vanquishable number
Shake these chains to earth like dew
You are many, they are few

Without a voice to question
The hollow aggression of public perception
Through all this time we rise
Human solutions

We're amplified adrenaline
Another flag's shadows cover us again
And on these steps, take back our days
And when we go, go out in a blaze

We'll go, go out in a blaze
Human pollution

In the people's war
Behind the writing on the wall
In the people's war
Searching, spoiling for a fall

Searching, spoiling for a fall
It's written in our blood

So don't misdirect your rage
Don't misdirect your rage
Don't misdirect your rage
Don't misdirect your rage

Human solutions

We're amplified adrenaline
Another flag's shadows cover us again
And on these steps, insurgent days
So when we go, go out in a blaze

We go, go out in a blaze
We'll go, go out in a blaze
