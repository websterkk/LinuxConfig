No more smiles and no more outrage
Apathy pervasive, emotions narcoleptic
No more smiles since fucking Sunday
Sinking feelings, drinking early, stinking septic

Stinking like a dream

Spoken outside in outside voices
Struck silent into shuddering and cold ground padded noises
Sucking myself up a truth that I don't need
Last nights, I don't believe

No slowing down
No faces smile, no lips that frown
Gray to neutral, every synapse, stinking thoughts, a pool of dinner
Wipe my mouth and hope to die

This street is cold, early morning noises
This body reeling, ugly early morning choices
No more drinks until fucking noon
Rotting teeth and gums, and a blackening that sets in soon

And an all revealing smile
Just falling down
Won't make these hours turn around
I wish I could remember what I'm trying to forget
