Face down. I'm stuck inside these boundaries that were put in place
To fucking quiet me... to bury me. I was given a uniform but soon
Learned that's just a disguise. The reality is misconstrued and subdued
Until your spirit dies. Born into a culture that teaches you to keep
Taking not giving. Will you live your life spending? Or will you spend
You life living?

Unlearn.

A control just like heroin, you stole from us all again. Cold hands around
Our throats big man, If we speak up you're silencing. Too big business
Minded, when you see vision you blind it. Propaganda mixed with power
Brought on one-sided violence. Ideas remain bulletproof so you can never
Fucking silence.
