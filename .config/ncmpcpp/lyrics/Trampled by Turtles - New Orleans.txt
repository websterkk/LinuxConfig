She followed the man she loved
All the way to New Orleans
She come back broken-hearted and mean

She tried to escape the pain
But sometimes it's all that's real
It's no excuse for living pain free, that's the deal

It's a bitch, ain't it babe
To live while you're young
I'm crushed that the world turned over so soon

A pile of old memories
Just lying all around
Seems like everywhere I look I've fallen to the ground

And I can't help it if it's over babe
You can't help it, though you tried
Your poor little soul is wearing pretty thin

It's a bitch, ain't it babe
To live while you're young
I'm crushed that the world turned over so soon
