So it came to pass
That I'd stayed with you long after they had left
So now you pace the halls
Talking to the oil portraits along the walls

I know you did what you did
But I was just a kid

Don't compare me now to how I was back then
No, don't compare me now to how I was back then

And this too shall pass
Long after they're done searching through your desk
They call it voyeurism
Not viewing it as a precaution

I know you did what you did
Cause you thought I'd never forgive

But we were both a little crazy when we were kids
Looking back on it, I would've done the same thing
Yeah, everyone was doing crazy shit back then

Maybe I'm not so crazy after all

Don't compare me now to how I was back then
No, don't compare me now to how I was back then
