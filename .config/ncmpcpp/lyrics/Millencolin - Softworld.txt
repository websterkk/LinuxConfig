One step forward two steps back
We're the masters of disaster
Pillowpride and shumway lies isn't what you expected
A solid demon crawls in you, at least that's what they're
Saying, but we don't care we're just launging now and
Got to keep our pinegalic post

In a softworld, from AMF to earl grey
In a softworld, it's softcore, but don't ask me now what
It's all about

Next stop is looking good
Cause you don't know what it offers
The treasurehunt was meant to be something ultra clean
Munkers say it's not ok
'Cause you're lost in what you're doing
But this is it when softcore's lit
And we won't change a shit

Take time to wonder if it's really worth it
So many broken kinder eggs
So many stolen lipton bags
Do we really give something back
