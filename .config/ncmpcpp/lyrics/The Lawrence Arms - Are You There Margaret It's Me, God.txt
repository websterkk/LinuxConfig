They told me where to go
(And I always follow)
They told me what to do
(I swallowed every drop down)
They told me bedtime stories
(Of how I'd rise above)
They told me they were true

I sat and thought about her
On the train ride out
Until my stomach turned
Like it's done for years now
I thought about her hips and thighs
With the red in my eyes
I felt my body burn
Burn, yeah.

Aeroplane, aeroplane
Don't leave without me
'Cause I'm out here all by myself
And I got no place to sleep
Aeroplane, aeroplane
Don't leave without me
'Cause I'm out here all by myself and I
Ain't got no place to sleep.

And you told me that you loved me
(I swallowed every drop down)
And you told me how it felt
Like being gagged and bound
And you told me you were leaving
On the last train out
And you told me, "Go to hell."

Well, let me tell you, beautiful,
I've been there
Believe me when I say I'm not afraid
Of destruction, sorrow, fear or regret.
I heard the devil call me by my name
I heard the devil call me by my name

Hey, yeah.

Aeroplane, aeroplane
Don't leave without me
'Cause I'm out here all by myself
And I got no place to sleep
Aeroplane, aeroplane
Don't leave without me
'Cause I'm out here all by myself and I
Ain't got no place to sleep.

Aeroplane, aeroplane
Don't leave without me
'Cause I'm out here all by myself
And I got no place to sleep.

Aeroplane, aeroplane
Don't leave without me
'Cause I'm out here
All by myself tonight
And I got no place to sleep.
Yeah, I'm out here all by myself tonight
Got no place to sleep
No, no, no, no -
Got no place to sleep
No, no, no, no.

Believe me when I say I'm not afraid
I heard the devil call me by my name
Believe me when I say I'm not afraid
I heard the devil call me by my name
