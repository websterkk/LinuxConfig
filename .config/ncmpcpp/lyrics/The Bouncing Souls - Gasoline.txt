Sex and violence has lost its charm, I need something to amuse
And war is boring, it's not enough, I need a shock down to my shoes
Pedophile lust, torture, blood in the dust, take all you can
As long as it's on a TV screen, keep it away from my house, man

I'm long gone
I'm long gone
I'm long gone

My senses are burned to the core, so fuck me hard, I still want more
Sedation now is what I need so I don't have to live with me
Slavery is still alive, somebody's praying
Take anything you want, just don't show me who I am

Sedate me with anything so I don't have to live with me
And tell me, tell me that I'm free
Kill me with everything until there's nothing left of me
And tell me, tell me that I'm free

Give me some gasoline
Give me some gasoline

The beginning of this new time is coming to an end
We have run from all our ills, but we won't run again
Toxic meat, political deceit, medicate me 'til I'm dead
And I'll take life from your can, just don't show me who I am

Sedate me with anything so I don't have to live with me
And tell me, tell me that I'm free
Kill me with everything until there's nothing left of me
And tell me, tell me that I'm free

Give me some gasoline
Give me some gasoline
Give me some gasoline
Give me some gasoline
Give me some gasoline
Give me some gasoline

Sedate me with anything so I don't have to live with me
Tell me, tell me that I'm free
Kill me with everything until there's nothing left of me
Tell me, tell me that I'm free

Tell me, tell me that I'm free
Give me some gasoline
Tell me, tell me that I'm free
Give me some gasoline

Tell me, tell me that I'm free
Give me some gasoline
Tell me, tell me that I'm free
Give me some gasoline

Give me some gasoline
Give me some gasoline
Give me some gasoline
Give me some gasoline
