I was kissing your salty lips
Wet from your nose as it started to drip, it was
Twenty below and you were shaking
I was a compass without a map, I was
A drifter on the side of the tracks, I was
Free at last, thought I could escape it
But I can't
And I won't, she keeps saying

Just 'cause you're sad again, it doesn't make you special at all
Just 'cause you're sad again, it doesn't make you special

Motivation, it comes and goes
Keepin' expectations low
So when I let you down, I won't feel so bad
Sloppy Steffy back at it again, callin' you up at 5 AM
"Have you been drinking?" Well of course I have
Why the hell would I be here if I wasn't?

Just 'cause you're sad again, it doesn't make you special at all
Just 'cause you're sad again, it doesn't make you special
I'm wakin' up again, knowing nothing really matters at all
Just 'cause you're sad again, it doesn't make you special

Woo!

Wooooooooooo!
Wooooooooooo!
Wooooooooooo!

Just 'cause you're sad again, it doesn't make you special at all
Just 'cause you're sad again, it doesn't make you special
I'm wakin' up again, knowing nothing really matters at all
Just 'cause you're sad again, it doesn't make you special
