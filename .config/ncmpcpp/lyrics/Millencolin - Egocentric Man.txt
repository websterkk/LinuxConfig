I dress up in jackboots and shirts colored brown
I don't kiss up but love kicking down
I've got no education but Jimmie is good
I love Scrooge but I hate Robin Hood

'Cause I'm an egocentric man
I've got a little narcissistic plan
So if you ever need a helping hand, I don't give a damn
I am an egocentric man

I sure do like country but Guthrie was wrong
It's only my land and for me to belong
My house should have been the last one here to be built
I was naturally born free from guilt

'Cause I'm an egocentric man
I've got a little narcissistic plan
So if you ever need a helping hand, I don't give a damn
I am an egocentric man

Yeah, I'm an egocentric man
I've got a little narcissistic plan
Yeah, I'm an egocentric man
And this will never be your land
If you ever need a helping hand, I don't give a damn
I am an egocentric man
An egocentric man
