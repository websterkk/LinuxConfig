We lie in bed for days
Empty bottles consuming empty space
I'm suffocating
If I go to you by train
It's forty-five blocks of seeing the same
Expressionless face

Debris is falling from the burning sky
Ashes from a once luminous life
Burn a candle in the window so I know you're still alive
Breathing but dead inside

Let's help each other bake this bread
There's nothing I'd rather be doing instead
I hear there's a full moon rising
It's the same thing every night
The gunshots sing and the people scream
The harmonies of this city

Well I'm not happy either
Let's tear this one down
Rebuild on virgin ground
A new life begins
