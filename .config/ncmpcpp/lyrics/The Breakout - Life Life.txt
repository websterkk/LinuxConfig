Tell me what your livin for
Where's your destination
No one said life was an easy ride
Crazy things they fill your dreams
That's the new sensation
Look down deep within you'll see
Things will turn out right

Breakout, turn around
Time to get on up and get your feet on the ground
Breakout,
Take a bite out of life,
Man don't you worry everything will be alright

Sitting in your room at night hiding from tomorrow
Takin chances is your plan, that's your new temptation
Day to day each step you take
Appetite-destruction
You know darkness escapes me,
Just to close your eyes

Breakout, turn around
Time to get on up and get your feet on the ground
Breakout,
Take a bite out of life,
Man don't you worry everything will be alright

Breakout, turn around
Time to wake on up and take a look around
Breakout,
Take a bite out of life,
Man don't you worry everything will be alright

Breakout, turn around
Time to get on up and get your feet on the ground
Breakout,
Take a bite out of life,
Man don't you worry everything will be alright
Breakout, turn around
Time to wake on up and take a look around
Breakout,
Take a bite out of life,
Man don't you worry everything will be alright
Breakout, turn around
Time to get on up and get your feet on the ground
Breakout,
Take a bite out of life,
Man don't you worry everything will be alright
