Looking back, wish I could say we left the past behind 
But you, you pushed me away
Dropping matches on the bridges that didn't need to burn
And I wish it didn't end this way 
Left with regret and the pain of words unsaid

I never saw it coming and I never saw the truth
I know I played a role in how things fell apart
But years have past and I can see it clearly
No matter what I said, nothing could have kept it from this end

How could you call yourself a friend
When the words coming from your mouth
Never meant a thing?
How could you call yourself a friend
When everything we were didn't mean a thing to you?

And when you broke down what we built
It made me second guess myself
It made me second guess all of us 
But time keeps moving on, and we keep moving on 
Always looking forward, we'll leave the past behind

And I keep asking, what is left?
What's left to say when the ties that bind have torn apart?

Looking back I realize no matter what we said 
Nothing could've changed the past 
Was it all for nothing? I guess we'll never know
But all that's left are bridges burnt and lessons learnt
