Someone said you're feeling ill
Well they've got this brand new pill
Does anything you want but it doesn't come cheap

Fast food particles stick to the veins
Car exhaust goes to the brain
Sickness is always free
Help doesn't come that easy

Lungs black with smoke
I watch my neighbors die
They've got no self-control
When they die no one cries

"I could give a fuck for you" is the song they're singing
So I wrote this one for us

Now the big hand's hit the hour
Could you give this up completely?
Whisper to me what you want
I would love to see you happy

And I'd come to visit soon
But these streets are filled with landmines
And these buildings lie in ruin
And I'm bleeding on the inside

I feel angry I feel tired
All bad habits turned to sickness
If they're all saints then I'm a liar
But I think its time we fix this
