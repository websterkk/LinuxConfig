With a light of this match
I could burn this place to the ground
Then fire engines'd scream
Down crowded streets onto the scene
And then I'd make it rain
Numb myself to never say your name
That I've uttered in anger
Said with confusion
Laughed over nervously
Said without sympathy
I must always remember:
There's no point to surrender

No more smiles;
Revolving like turnstiles
No more deliberation;
Analytical creation
See I'm incapable, a predepressionist
This is delivered with courage
Muddled in tension
Lashed out in honesty
Someone come and save me

I'm dying to tell you
This kills it forever, it was already dead
I'm dying to tell you
This kills us forever, we were already dead
And I'm just fine
I haven't called you but I haven't had the time
These thoughts are stale
I've been revolving like turnstiles
