Telling me that you're in control 
I've heard it all and it's getting old
Chasing down regret from the night before
But every night you're back for more
Life can pass you by, so let's get it right 
Decisions made? Just think again 
Don't fill your life with regrets

I know that you see the truth
There's not a moment to lose
I know how hard it can be 
You've got to try and break free

They're the best days of our lives 
Why waste them standing in line?
But there's always a path you can take
Break free and take pride in decisions you've made
