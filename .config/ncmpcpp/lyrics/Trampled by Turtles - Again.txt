Living like a window
Stuck wide open
Take it all in
But don't let it burn you out
I know you have your doubts
But just forget them now

Will I see you
Will I see you
Will I see you
Again

Will I see you
Will I see you
Will I see you
Again

Dreaming doesn't make much
Sense anymore
All the demons
They're howling at your door
Still you beg for more
Ain't it over yet

Will I see you
Will I see you
Will I see you
Again

Will I see you
Will I see you
Will I see you
Again
