Nothing is safe
Nothing is safe

If we get caught we'll be captured, we'll be questioned
If we get caught we'll be kept with other suspects
If we get caught we'll be taken, we will be arrested

If we get caught we'll be captured, we'll be questioned
If we get caught we'll be kept with other suspects
If we get caught we'll be taken, we will be arrested

If we extend our instruments kike lovers' arms to each others' necks
We'll be put to death
And if we let the treble clefs fall apart on our troubled heads
We'll be put to death

Nothing
Nothing is safe
Nothing
Nothing is safe
