You called to say you're going away
Speak in code, our voices shake
The pigs are much more clever
Than we ever would have thought

You called to say they're on their way
The lines are tapped, nothing here is safe
Just get out of Gotham
All these cops want to bring us down

Open up your mouth, sing it out
Create a good space for the sound
I swear I swore you off forever, then you come around
This love, this love, this love's gonna drag us down

Clicks betray the call's been traced
Lines collapse, the static breaks
Connection left us severed
I stretch my limbs across

You call to say the anchor weighs
The ocean down to control the waves
I'm getting out of Gotham
All these cops are starting to bring me down

Open up your mouth, sing it out
Create a good space for the sound
I swear I swore you off forever, then you come around
This love, this love, this love's gonna drag us down

Better off alone together
Better off alone together
Better off alone together
All this getting high brings me down

Open up your mouth, sing it out
Create a good space for the sound
I swear I swore you off forever, then you come around
This love, this love, this love's gonna drag us down
