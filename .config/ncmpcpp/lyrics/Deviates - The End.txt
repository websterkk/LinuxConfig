Could it be, is this the end?
I've seen it coming from a far and I welcome it like a friend.
A lost love, like a bright light.
The direction I'm lacking is leading me.
So far I haven't seen a reason to be.
I've lost count of the shackles that bind me.
I'm not alone, I don't that comforting.
One more time it's my turn to make amends.
I make my own rules.
I'm sure tomorrow I'll break them again,
It's getting easy to excuse my mistakes.
I'll walk this line until my conscience abandons me.
Times when you tell me that you wish you could die
And then you give me shit for even trying to be a friend.
There's no question,
I'd take your place in the light and give this darkness to you.
So here we are again.
Our paths diverge but I'll see you in the end.
Here we are I can see the end.
The direction I'm lacking is leading me.
I'm so tired and shit, I'm beat.
I'm not alone I don't find that comforting.
