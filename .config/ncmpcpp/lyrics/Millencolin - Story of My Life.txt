Story of my life, story of my life
Well let's just say it's a fork and a knife
There's one thing on my mind, one thing all the time
I gotta fill my mouth
Got no favorite meal, got no favorite meal
I say every meal is clean if it fills me up for real
My belly's big and that's just the start
My appetite's my heart

And when I've had enough, I just throw up and laugh
This time, this time it's not a cow
Kind of personal, can't explain to you why
This time, this time it's not a cow
So Mr. PC are you ready to bow

Breakfast in bed, breakfast in bed
The bed is in the kitchen so it's easy to be fed
And when I'm fed, yes when I am fed
I go right back to bed
Food and sleep watch, food and sleep watch
Theese things should keep me from having too much
My belly is big and that's just the start
My appetite's my heart

Sometimes it feels that I could kill for desert

But this time, this time it's not a cow
It's kind of personal, can't explain to you why
This time, this time it's not a cow
So Mr. PC are you ready to bow

The story of my life
A big fork and the sharpest knife
I guess this solid, solid, solid, solid bridge leads me on
To the nearest fridge

And when I've had enough I just throw up and laugh
So this time, this time it's not a cow
It's kind of personal, can't explain to you why
This time, this time it's not a cow
So Mr. PC are you ready to bow
This time, this time it's not a cow, not a cow
No this time, this time, this time, this time it's not a cow
Not a pig, sheep, chicken, moose, duck, snake, horse or frog
