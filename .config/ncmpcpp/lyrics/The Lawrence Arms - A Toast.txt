You tell me that you want to go to heaven
But you run around acting like you're gonna live forever
Well, you tell me that you're going through hell
Well, you're putting others through it and you say that I smell

Like I haven't had a shower in 23 days
Like an unbalanced beer can two minutes too late
A look like a stale face from a fresh grave
Chip on my shoulder and an eye full of rage

Can you taste that beer with your back to the bar?
Can you smell that cigarette without letting down your guard?

Ten cans, 4 AM friends
The sad thing is that you've always been like this
Moaning in a bed shaped like a hearse
Believe the lies that you tell yourself

You tell me that my problem is thinking
I can chase it away with a problem like drinking
Well, you tell me you don't want to get old
Got a party on the line and a grave on hold

Like a drunk operator, like a game of roulette
Like a martini balanced on a whiffleball bat
When the hard wind blows, it's gonna fall down
When the wind blows there'll be broken glass all around

Can you taste that beer with your back to the bar?
Can you smell that cigarette without letting down your guard?

Ten cans, 4 AM friends
The sad thing is that you've always been like this
Moaning in a bed shaped like a hearse
Believe the lies that you tell yourself, things can never get worse

Can you taste that beer with your back to the bar?
Can you smell that cigarette with a smell so far away?

Ten cans, 4 AM friends
The sad thing is that you've always been like this
Like a bright shiny apple with a worm inside
Believe the lies that you tell yourself, this is the only way to die

This is the only way to die
This is the only way to die, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
This is the only way to die, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
This is the only way to die
