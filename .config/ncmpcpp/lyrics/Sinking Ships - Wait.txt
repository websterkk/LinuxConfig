Waiting for meanings, still I've been trying to make some sense
Al this wasting life waiting for nothing
Confused and searching for so long that sometimes it's not just all you know, it becomes everything you are
Trying to make some sense of a life spent searching aimlessly, when for us, this is everything
I won't wait, I won't wait for nothing
Through the graves of what we've been through clinging to a life worth living
And they said that life is what you choose and they lied to you
No love, no soul, no sadder sound than the crushing of our hearts
And we all know where we come from, but were never going home
Trying
Reaching
Breathing
But still out of breath again
Out of words again, trying to explain everything, but I can't say anything
