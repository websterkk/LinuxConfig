Killing time, the TV's on, with a bottle of shit
Buried needle, the record player's forgotten how to spin
So, you're feeling useless, well the bidding starts at $19.95
Well, while the survey says, cheers and applause, another hour dies

Jacking off again, 40 in the fridge
Have these dreams put to sleep
So call me up and tell me something
I'm dying to believe

I don't know, I don't care
I just sit and stare now
I don't think
I just listen to the drone of this old being

Friday night, stepping out, talking to the same
So how's your family and how is school? Conversation strained
Force endurance from this class, it's 11:45
Two more hours lumber past, I feel like I tried

Fucking off again, talking to this bitch
She hates me and I hate her
So shut me up and take me somewhere
I'm dying to leave

I don't know, I don't care
I just sit and stare now
I don't think
I just listen to the drone of this machine

I don't know, I don't care
I just sit and stare now
I don't think
I just listen to the voice of this machine
