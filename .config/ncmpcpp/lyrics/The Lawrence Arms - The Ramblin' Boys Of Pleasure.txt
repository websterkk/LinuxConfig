A million times a day I try to fail or fail to try.
It's an easy way to live. It's a lifeless way to die.
I used to hear "Son, you've got a lot to learn."
I used to hear a lot... like the slow dull burn
Of paper and tobacco and the bad breath smoke singin'
"Hey man, lemme tell you a joke."
"Well what's attached to a leash that it made itself?"
"The punchline is the way that you've been fuckin' yourself."

Sit down, shut up. It's a long ride yet.
I'm here to show you something not easy to forget.
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a goddamn shame.
One day until retirement. It was God's way.

I'm ready or not. You're here, I come.
There's tears on my cheeks (there's tears on my cheeks) from being so dumb.

There's proof painted on the roof and it's rainin' and I hate it
I hate it
I hate it
I hate it

Things have changed forever.
We're the ramblin' boys of pleasure.
