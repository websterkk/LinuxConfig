Another senseless week of crowded thoughts and crooked teeth
Morning frost and frozen sidewalks
All these days that burned inside us swell up in the silence
Of snowflakes falling magically

But the magic fades into the memory
Sleigh bells ringing, laughing all the way
Cold hands of winter grasp as I gasp for breath
Is this my last? No thoughts of dying, no more self-loathing for today

So deck the halls with drunken folly
Swallow resolutions, line our stomachs with illusions
Car engines sputtering like these smoke filled dreams
Mistletoe and colored light bulbs

And the kiss of winter fades into the memory
Angels singing, lift me off the ground
Yesterday is frozen in the revelry
Tomorrow's melting, let's raise our glasses to these faintly falling ashes
