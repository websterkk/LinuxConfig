Another fairytales
About this endless feelings
And when it's heating up
I think I'M stuck forever
I try to lose some weight
I try to get in shape but
In the end I always end up lost inside myself

Up and down gets nothing done
I just keep it waiting
Round and round out with the thumb
No, I just keep on waiting

Twelve numbers stare at me
Sometimes it's not that easy
Instead of waking up
I think I'll sleep forever
What happened to the dayroutines
That always kept me going?
Where the hell are all the dreams I had about my life?

...Now, but someday I'll get the time
To get me back on the right track and no more slack
Got to keep an open mind
I got to get out of this daily grind
And deep inside I know I will
