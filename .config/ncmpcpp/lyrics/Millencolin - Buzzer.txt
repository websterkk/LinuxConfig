Take your silly words and listen to yourself
'Cause I'm living my life tonight
And nothing's gonna hurt me
Can't you understand that I can be myself
Without everything, without anything, without any help from you

We're not having fun, we never really laughed
We have to get things before we end ourself

What about me?
Do you care enough to see that
I can't live my life this way and that you don't understand?
What about me?
Am I the one who's going down
Cause sometimes I can't find myself
And I'm wondering if this is really me?

I remember those days when we first met
How simple things were then
With no heartache and no pain
Now things change so fast
That we must take the time to talk things over and
Listen to our mind
