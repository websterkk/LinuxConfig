with hearts like hand grenades
and minds like concrete and steel
the thinnest of lines divide us
the most closed of minds confine us

the sound of a thousand screaming voices
should be some sort of threat
the sound of a thousand screaming voices
should be a sign that it's not dead yet

what happened to songs I used to lose my voice to
what happened to songs I used to have to beat my chest
through
what happened to songs that made me think
do you remember when the message mattered

the sound of a thousand screaming voices
should be some sort of threat
the sound of my screaming voice
should be a sign that I'm not dead yet

yes we're safe
safe from danger
because we've given up on the fact
that ideas are still dangerous
your mind is the most dangerous thing you have
