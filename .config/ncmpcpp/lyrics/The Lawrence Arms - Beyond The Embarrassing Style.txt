Is it hard for you to sleep at night?
The powder glowing in your smile
And is it hard to die a fraction at a time?
Is it just too hard to say goodbye?

Your life spins like a carousel
Your hopes are buried in a wishing well
Awake in a grave that you dug yourself
Just keep on betting on that horse you love

I can see the sadness in his face
Deep behind his lacquered eyes
A real devastation quaking in his jawline
The demon always comes alive

Your life spins like a carousel
Your hopes are buried in a wishing well
Awake in a grave that you dug yourself
Just keep on betting on that horse you love

Do you ever see the light of day?
Did you ever think that you would live this way?
Is it just so hard to sleep at night?
Is it just too hard for you to say goodbye?

And when the sun goes down
You'd better paint the town
Just keep riding now
Your horse will never touch the ground

Your life spins like a carousel
Your hopes are buried in a wishing well
Dead or alive, it's just so hard to tell
It looks like you've already found your hell

You've found your hell
