There's a young world standing strong in the tide
With vision not so blinding yet
Anger, just one chance that we get

In the rain
In the rain
In the rain
In the rain

With the blood on the nightsticks, a new mark is made
The terror evaporates
Oh, in the rain
In the rain coming down on a new day

Dust to dust, a violation of trust, justice
That maybe somebody someday will understand
We didn't live and die in vain
The voices of the people will come down like rain

Like rain
Like rain
We're like rain
We're like rain

And though there's blood on the nightsticks, it's never too late
The streets are burning bright in the light of the flames
Of the flames
New suns for a new day

Broken faces, plastic nerves
Selling the passion to rot in the suburbs
Plastic faces, broken nerves
Selling the passion, we rot in the suburbs

The world's in traction, do all our shots miss?
From action to fashion, we rot in the office
A world in traction where all our shots miss
From action to fashion, we rot in the office

Rot in the office
Rot in the office

World in traction
From action to fashion
But we're not gonna rot
Building Babylon with our life and death

So we spit and run
One voice, one breath
Spit and run
One voice, one breath

Spit and run
