Tired and beaten.
Voice withering away to nothing.
I'm walking in the footsteps made by those who have been defeated.
I've watched men and women made of steel get burned up
As easily as dry leaves and left depleted
All of my heroes have been ruined or written out of history.
I could be destined to fade away like so many before me
But as long as my heart keeps beating.
I still can't stop screaming.
Silence.
Is Violence.
I'm Bending.
I'm Breaking.
I'm Broken.
I'm still Alive
