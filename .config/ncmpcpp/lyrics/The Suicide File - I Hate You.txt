Everywhere is still
Everything is restless in my heart
I hate the way this feels
Suddenly I'm scared to be apart
The days are dark when you're not around
The air is getting hard to breathe
I wish that you would just put me down
I wish that I could go to sleep

Loving you is suicide
I don't know should I go or should I stay
I'm tryna to keep myself alive
Knowing there's a chance it's all too late
But I heard you say you loved me
That's the part I can't forget
And I wish that you come save me
Cos I'm standing over the edge

I should let you go
Tell myself the things I need to hear
But my brain is wired wrong
That's why I'm loving you when you're not here
Feels like I drown in your every word
And every breath that's in between
Somehow you get me where it really hurts
It's killing every part of me

Loving you is suicide
I don't know should I go or should I stay
I'm tryna to keep myself alive
Knowing there's a chance it's all too late
But I heard you say you loved me
That's the part I can't forget
And I wish that you come save me
Boy cos I'm standing over the edge

Loving you is suicide
And my world's about to break
And I... had as much as I can take
And love is a long way down

Loving you is suicide
And it's getting harder everyday
I'm tryna to keep myself alive
Knowing there's a chance it's all too late
And I'm way past every moment
But I'm still determined to fight
And I know it's taking all my strength
To keep these emotions alive
Loving you is suicide
