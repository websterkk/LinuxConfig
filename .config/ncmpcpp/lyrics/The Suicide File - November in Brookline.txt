Fate flickers like a newsreel
It's dancing across the dark wood restaurants
The empty sidewalks
And the hotel lobbies that have started to fade
So that the deep reds are now a dirty pink
And the elegance they had before has been stripped and covered in dust
And there are countless yesterdays
That were supposed to be something more
But as time blurs them, the edges soften
And you can carve a monument out of broken glass and sand
Nothing is uglier than former beauty
It's the curse of the starlet
Sunlight can be a horrible thing
Fate still smiles demurely as the leaves clog the gutters
And the red bricks chip and sink further into the ground
Time wears you down
Time will spit on you
Time marches on
Its promises fell through
And there are countless yesterdays where promises fell through
