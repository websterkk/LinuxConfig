The plan's begun to snuff you out
No need for subtleties
It's too late for that now
A facelift ripped through flesh, left bleeding
The plastic beauty radiates

The dam has cracked and sprung a leak
The pressure's going to blow the whole damn thing
Flood of mammoth proportions, they call it cleansing
Wash the less beautiful ones out

Calculated cold-blooded vision
A money driven regime
They won't try to fix what they've broken
Throw the old one out
Replacing human beings

The trains are revealing
Lookouts as they spider web above the scene
A new Chicago with the old one left dwindling in between
The machines tore a path straight through the ghetto
It's an ugly makeover
