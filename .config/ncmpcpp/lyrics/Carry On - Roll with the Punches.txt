Sometimes I wonder if I'm the only one
Who even gives a fuck
I watch it fall apart and I want to build it up
But you just turn away
I can't do this by myself so look for other ways
I'm trying to get it out of this rut
The dust has built for too long
If this means so much more than words
Than show me sign and quit dropping the lines
Staying positive was just a setup
So you could take the punch when they let you down
(It's where we're heading)
So x your fist, show me what's left inside
I'm so sick of everyone's excuses
I want to tear them down
Let down before but never again
I won't buy into your shit
I'll just believe in my friends
If that's something that you don't understand
Than just sit back and watch it fall apart again
