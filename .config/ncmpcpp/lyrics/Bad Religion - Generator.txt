Like a rock, like a planet
Like a fucking atom bomb
I'll remain unperturbed by the joy and the madness
That I encounter everywhere I turn

I've seen it all along
In books and magazines
Like a twitch before dying
Like a pornographic sea

There's a flower behind the window
There's an ugly laughing man
Like a hummingbird in silence
Like the blood on my door

It's the generator

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Like the blood on my door
Wash me clean and I will run
Until I reach the shore

I've known it all along
Like the bone under my skin
Like actors in a photograph
Like paper in the wind

There's a hammer by the window
There's a knife on the floor
Like turbines in darkness
Like the blood on my door

It's the generator
