I can't connect to this sacred object
The bar was open but for me the bar was closing
I like to suffer in a silent way
I can't get through the days without a glaze across the face

You're so smart and witty
And funny and pretty and skinny
But tonight I don't feel right
I can't wait until I'm back in the city

A lonely rage
The hunger is the meanest cage
A lonely rage
The hunger is the meanest cage

I felt like we were at a loss
This is the cost of art, the way you hit me with your grin
And now I'm almost over it
Soon you'll set me free and raise a flag half-mast

I'm so stupid and speechless and burned-out, sedated and faceless
And sometimes it feels like I don't even exist in this place
I'm momentum in transit, alive in the rhythms of movement
It's when I stop and start thinking that I realize all the people I'm missing
