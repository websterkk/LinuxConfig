The days blur into one
And I float around the edge of them
Searching for something
That'll make me feel alive again
These past few weeks in a hell of my own creation
I try vegan food, I take up medication

I hope you're doing fine on your own
Cause after everything we've been through
You better hope
You'll find someone, and you'll try, but you won't
Cause after everything we've been through
Oh baby, I wanna know

What you were thinking
When you saw me in the produce section
Buying organic food
Making healthy selections
I asked how you've been
Not that it's any of my business
But you know me I've always been a little masochistic

I hope you're doing fine on your own
Cause after everything we've been through
You better hope
You'll find someone, and you'll try, but you won't
Cause after everything we've been through
Oh baby, I wanna know

I hope somehow I never see you again
And if I do it's at your funeral or better yet
I hope the world explodes
I hope that we all die
We can watch the highlights in hell
I hope they're televised

I hope you're doing fine on your own
Cause after everything we've been through
You better hope
You'll find someone, and you'll try, but you won't
Cause after everything we've been through
Oh baby, I wanna know
