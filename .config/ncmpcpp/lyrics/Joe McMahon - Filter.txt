While you sleep, in the comfort of your bed, someone's coming after you.
And when you awake, to the billboards on your way to work, someone's coming after you.

They're stealing your lives and they're selling them back to you and look at the lives we waste.
They're feeding the lines in the interest of commerce, excuses for wars we wage.
They got the bombs and the guns to look after the country's economy.
But we got a plan to get back all the hours and days and the years they take.

We say, "We'll smoke this city to the filter,
we'll empty every bottle, you'll see us by the river.
We'll bring back those things you can't remember,
like smiling in the winter.
You're smiling while they burn your lives.
Burn your lives. And you've heard their lies.
You've heard their lies."
