Oh, you say you're lonely
Pulled away by the tide and lost at sea
All you sense is something
So heavy that you can't breathe

You can't breathe
You can't see
You can't see

Let me take you to a place where the sun warms your face
And the sound of the waves takes you away
And the ghosts on the boardwalk keep you company
Where the city meets the sea
Where the city meets the sea

Oh, you say you're empty
Stripped away by the pain of broken dreams
All of these emotions
Clouding up your eyes 'til you can't see

You can't see
You can't breathe
You can't see

Let me take you to a place where the sun warms your face
And the sound of the waves takes you away
And the ghosts on the boardwalk keep you company
Where the city meets the sea
Where the city meets the sea

Carry nothing you don't need
The wind is there to guide your feet
You're in good company

Oh, you say you're lonely

Let me take you to a place where the sun warms your face
And the sound of the waves takes you away
And the ghosts on the boardwalk keep you company
Where the city meets the sea
Where the city meets the sea
