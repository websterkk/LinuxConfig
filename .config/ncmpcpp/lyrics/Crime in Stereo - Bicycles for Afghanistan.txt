So I wanted goals. I saw all I needed was:
-A home with a view of something beautiful
-A woman that I trusted
-The friends that I grew up with

But it was asking too much for us to pray things stay in exactly the same way. And so we drift together saying "Every mirror shows the same ugly shell I've shared forever". We drift together, yet apart and alone. The only role for these lonely souls. And you can see the by the lonely numbers on my bank receipts, the lonely space between these sheets, by the ravenous company I keep, comforts are few and far between. But just this once I'll have you know, this is not a lonely soul.

This world has other sorrows than love.
