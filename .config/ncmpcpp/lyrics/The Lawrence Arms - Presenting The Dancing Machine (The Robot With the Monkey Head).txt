Day one has just begun
I'm burnt, broken, dazed and numb
Beginnings feel more like ends
Friends feel less and less like friends

Shake, shake, shake, shake
Off another dumb mistake
I'm stupider than you
You can see it in my face

See it in my sloping brow
And forehead
I'm missing all the missives
Because I'm stone dead

We're fuck ups and perverts, we're dickweeds and drunks
Drowning in rivers chained into trunks
This new work is awkward, I don't like the lines
I hate all the people with pinpointed eyes

Shake, shake, shake, shake 
Off another dumb mistake
I'm stupider than you
You can see it in my face

Fuck what we say
And all that we do
I'm saving myself
For something beautifully true
