The best and the brightest are rotting away
Yesterday's heroes are garbage today
We made the wrong choices, we took the wrong paths
It's easier now just to think of the past
Loose lips sank ships and no one survived
What could have been is all just a lie
High hopes and potential just led to shit
Everyone failed, everyone quit
We passed out, We dropped out
We missed out, We lost out...
