Detachment - Still asking "Are we all alone" 
2 hands meet, on our knees, no one heard a sound 

"Fall now, Into a dream" 
"Come drown, down here with me" 

Thousands Passed, Unwritten - How much time is left? 
They're screaming "Salvation!" - False hope without shame 

"Fall now, Into a dream" 
"Come drown, down here with me" 

Wake Up 
Waiting outside in the bitter cold 
Frozen winter brings the days of old 
The time has come, to say our last goodbyes 
Destination: final sunrise
