Where did they go, where are th finer things in life
The things we never knew and never cared to have?
We had each other, everything we'd need..
There was never a time you'd turn your back on me
And for so long there wasn't a day you wouldn't call
Stop by or stop in to go cause trouble
Three in the morning while the neighborhood sleeps
We saw the rest of our lives
We never had or needed it's not a fair trade
I know you're trying and I hear the view is twice as nice when you're dying
And now you face a seemingly eternal night
Don't sleep. I won't
I won't lose this fight, more than a friend you're a part of me
Defining all that I've known and sharing all that I've seen
Don't turn your eyes away from me
I fear now I'm a friend who is failing
Lied to and cheated we've been fucking robbed
We've lost touch with ourselves
What we had is gone, and its not a fair trade
I know you're trying and I hear the view is twice as nice when you're dying
But I care too much to see you waste away
This time I know you're going to be okay
You're okay and I'm all right
Trials come but together we'll be all right. I know you'll be all right
Take my time. Take everything of mine
Can't replace this space with memories and reminders
With your face to the ground, you've forced me to my knees
I can't stay here I won't watch you leave
So long, farewell my friend
I'll see you again but only time will tell if I'll wear a smile or meet a better man, maybe I never will
