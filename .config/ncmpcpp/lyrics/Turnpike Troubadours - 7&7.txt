[Verse 1]
Back when you, when you were my darlin'
I, I didn't mind to lose a little sleep
I, I didn't mind to do a little walkin'
My reputation never meant that much to me
How do I find that old familiar feeling
The one that carried me so many years ago?
When fun was dominos and Seven-Up and Seagram's
Things were simple then, just movin' nice and slow

[Pre Chorus 1]
Ain't it strange?
Ain't it strange?

[Chorus]
Well I had no clue
I'd be the boy who
Your mama warned you about
Well I had no clue
I'd be the boy who
Your mama warned you about

[Verse 2]
Well, that old scene is always coming to me
I, I see you standing with your husband and your child
And you're a picture of strength, grace, and beauty
And me, I'm just a fool in a supermarket aisle
Well I, I know "Hello" would surely end up awkward
I never had the knack for talkin' any way
And you're not the kind for bendin' over backwards
Smile and turn my shopping cart around and walk away

[Pre Chorus 1]
Ain't it strange?
Ain't it strange?

[Chorus]
Well I had no clue
I'd be the boy who
Your mama warned you about
Well I had no clue
I'd be the boy who
Your mama warned you about

[Bridge]
Well, ain't it strange how well I knew you back when I was seventeen?
Loving you was easy, babe, but I was just a child
And these days you ain't nothin', just an interstate daydream
Folks were sleepin' and we were runnin' wild

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I still do my share of sleepin' on the floor
Not sure if anybody knows me anymore

[Chorus]
Well I had no clue
I'd be the boy who
Your mama warned you about
Well I had no clue
I'd be the boy who
Your mama warned you about
