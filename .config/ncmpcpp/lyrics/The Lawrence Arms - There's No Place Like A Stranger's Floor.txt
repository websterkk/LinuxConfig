Teeth ripped out of gums hit
Sparkling gray squares of concrete
Screams in technicolor pain
Doubled over, spitting blood

Freezing rain never felt so good
To wake up in some town, on some floor, to some sound
Voices rattle through my veins
You're slowly imploding, your worlds are corroding

Please let it work itself out
We've got time to melt
You haven't said a single thing
A six month reoccurring dream

Oil stains glisten in this light
Fluorescent yellow, blue and red
It's not worth talking
When everything goes left unsaid

Freezing rain slants down in icy sheets
On some street where someone is cursing what they've done
And walking quickly toward the train
Cold and dejected in a brightly lit steel frame

Please let it work itself out
We've got time to melt
You haven't said a single thing
A six month reoccurring dream

Your eyes are a cloudy morning
Your lips are this sealed letter
Ineptly yours, sincerely sorry
It's something you feel in the sole of your shoe on a loud city bus on some aching afternoon
