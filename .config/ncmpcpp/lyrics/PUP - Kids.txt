Just like the kids
I've been navigating my way
Through the mind numbing reality of a godless existence
Which, at this point in my hollow and vapid life
Has erased what little ambition I've got left

And I've embraced the calamity
With an attachment and a passive disinterest
Living out the back of my '97 Camry
Wondering how the hell I got myself into this

I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I don't care about nothing but you
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause I don't care about nothing
I don't care about nothing but you
No, I don't care about nothing

She said "I'm sick of it all
Your little games are getting old
Your little songs are getting way too literal
How about some goddamn subtlety for a change?"

She said "I feel like I've come untethered
In a room without walls
I'm drifting on the dark and empty sea of nothing
It doesn't feel bad, it feels like nothing at all."

I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I don't care about nothing but you
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause I don't care about nothing

And I had it maxed out
I had a feeling, oh
Nothing is working
And everything's bleeding, oh
I should've tapped out
Given in to my demons, oh

It's alright it's just a flesh wound
You said you'd never saw it coming
I'm pretty happy lying here with you
It's pretty good to feel something

I don't care about nothing but you
No I don't care about nothing
I don't care about nothing but you
No I don't care about nothing

And I had it maxed out
I had a feeling, oh
Nothing is working
And everything's bleeding, oh
I should've tapped out
Given in to my demons, oh
And I had it maxed out (I had it maxed out)
And nothing is working (Nothing is working)
And everything's bleeding, oh
