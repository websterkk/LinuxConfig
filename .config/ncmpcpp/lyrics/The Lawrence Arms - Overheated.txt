Three days, no happy endings
Highways, I'm hallucinating
I wish I wasn't so mathematic
I wish I hadn't overheated

Heartbeats across a crowed room
April Fool, give me a week or two
These drinks are hitting me so hard
I wish I had an angel watching over me

Set up another round
It's raining

Six more drinks before I drown, bottoms up and spirits down
Have my words lost all weight?
This is weighing on me
Have I got nothing left to say?

Now I remember all the words
Through my smoky eyes, a blurred hotel room stirred
I'm waiting to hear you through the static
Three more cigarettes, a time to call off all regrets

This is every selfish song
This is all those moments bleeding
Maybe I made a huge mistake
I always thought that it would come to this

March came without a cost
April falls into the dream again
In May I'll cut myself off, at a loss for words
It doesn't mean I'm really over it

Set up another round
Set up another round
It's raining

Six more drinks before I drown, bottoms up and spirits down
Have my words lost all weight?
This is weighing on me
Have I got nothing left to say?

Have I got nothing left to say?
Have I got nothing left?
Have I got nothing left to say?

And on the 13th of September, I swear I'll remember
Even if it doesn't make any sense
March 30th we'll be desperate, a happy birthday to me
What a spineless overstatement
