Don't follow and burn the future
Believing teachings which defend a past
Conceived to deceive us
To elevate a ruling class

So we dream with all the love that you threw away
We dream truth seeking, in the movement we stay
We dream in love with this resistance we play
We dream when we go and we dream when we say

So far
Carry it on
So far
Carry it over

We dream, now listen to the voice of the land
We dream, defying all the killing commands
We give our restlessness to fight for the truth
We give healing from the fountain of youth

Our own truth
Our own truth
Our own truth
Our own truth
