Telephone, telephone
What did you scream into your telephone, telephone?
What did you scream into your telephone, telephone?

I'm a shit stain slave with a grind of my own
I work day and night, less respect than a juggalo
I'm frying on the outside and frozen in the center
I'm telling you, I'm telling you to watch out for my temper

You won't like me when I'm angry
You'll see banners everywhere
The street where I'm from in the town where I live
Is now barely even there

Telephone, telephone
What did you scream into your telephone, telephone?
What did you scream into your telephone, telephone?

I haven't had fun in what seems like years
I had a thumbs up for you, but it was caught in the gears
These tears are just onion eyes, this heart is just broken
This body is a break room where the burnouts are smoking

This body is a break room where the burnouts are smoking

What did you scream into your telephone, telephone?
Telephone

I'm a clown, I'm just here to entertain
Tear me up and stuff me down the drain
I'm a clown, I'm just here to entertain
Tear me up and stuff me down the drain
