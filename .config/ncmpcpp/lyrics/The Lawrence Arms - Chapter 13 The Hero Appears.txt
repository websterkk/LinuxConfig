The well went dry, the blood thinned out
I scraped through a thousand layers of paint-like years
The secret's in, congested grins sigh
I'm trying to find places to breathe now

If this were a book, I'd call this song the final chapter
And if you read it, you'd be laughing
If it could end right now
The last lines would be

My body jolted in and out of stolen sound waves
The world expands or shrinks on any given Monday
Tuesday evening dyes a room blue
Friday's window has its own view

If this were a book, I'd call this song the final chapter
And if you read it, you'd be laughing
If it could end right now
The last lines would be

"Good friend, how loud do 
You want life to shout her 
Answers in your ear?"

Streetlights are streaming by on stiff necks
Connected blurs brand the design of things
Keep on counting them, or maybe hold your breath
I'm trying to exhale you softly

Don't be so vain, I'm not impressed in past tense
I don't do impressions

The blood has dried
(Good friend, how loud do...)
Now I can wash my hands with tears you've cried
(You want life to shout her...)
If you could frame this feeling
(Good friend, how loud do...)
At night, it would whisper to me
(You want life to shout her...)

"Good friend, how loud do 
You want life to shout her 
Answers in your ear?"
