This raft is hard to steer
The water's low this time of year
The smell of old decay
Is seeping into my sweater

And all the run-off shit
From the nearby development
Is soaking through my shoes
I'm barely keeping it together
Like

I'm not tryna stick it to you
But I've been trying hard getting through to you
I'm not gonna lie, let's face it
You know I won't take it
I'm never gonna take it

You didn't even notice
Just running through the motions
Don't test my patience
And I just can't take it no more

Holy shit! It's coming down
Three feet of snow, the frozen ground
Stuck in the tent for days
And you started laughing

You said that it's a sign
Let's get high out of our minds
And throw away the map
Just to see what would happen

I'm not tryna stick it to you
But who thought of this in the first place?
I've been trying to get through to you
'Cause you're losing it in the worst way

You've always got me on the hook
And you didn't even notice
Back in the old neighborhood
Just running through the motions

You know just how to piss me off
Don't test my patience
You're always up to no good
And I just can't take it

Even when I know I should
I dunno what to do
'Cause I'd still wanna hang with you
Whenever I could

I'm not tryna stick it to you
But I've been trying to get through to you

And you didn't even notice
Just running through the motions
Don't test my patience
'Cause I just can't take it

You've always got me on the hook
And I just can't take it
Back in the old neighborhood
And I just can't take it

You know just how to piss me off
Don't test my patience
You're always up to no good
And I just can't take it
Even when I know I should
