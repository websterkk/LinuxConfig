The stars don't shine above our night.
The city lights are too fucking bright.
So let's let 'em burn till the morning comes.
There's laughter and poison to shade our eyes.

And if you're looking for the rest of us
We're probably hanging out by the bar
Looking for quarters for the pool table.
We got the jukebox playing GNR

Another round of beers for all my friends,
I thought those summer nights would never end.
We all could open up our mouths and say, "We are not the world."

And I could sit in this spot all day and see nothing around me change.
We could open our mouths and say that we won't be a part of it.

Are you listening or waiting to speak in this conversation?
Are you listening at all?

I could sit in this spot all day and see nothing around me change.
We are not the world.
