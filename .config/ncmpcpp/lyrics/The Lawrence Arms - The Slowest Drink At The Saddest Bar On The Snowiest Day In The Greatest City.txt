My eyes opened to the emptiness
My face was nothing but crooked lines
I guess somewhere I really fell behind
My feet were cold against the bathroom tile

Took a shower just to pass the time
My mind was full, too much to figure out

Walked through the snow to a bar where there's no one I know
Drink slow, drink slow with nowhere to go
And when I leave I'll be singing this song
Summer's gone, carry on, I'm a ghost in the dawn

I was lost on the airplanes, I was high on the fast trains
My heart was a bird in a small cage
And I was drunk on the radio waves
I was drunk, I was drunk on the radio waves

Too much coffee, I'm not steady now
Quiet apartment, ears are ringing loud
Winter drowns out all the city sounds

Hang my towel over the shower rod
So many hours just hanging on
So many chances have come and gone

Walked through the snow to a bar where there's no one I know
Drink slow, drink slow with nowhere to go
And when I leave I'll be singing this song
Summer's gone, carry on, I'm a ghost in the dawn

I was lost on the airplanes, I was high on the fast trains
My heart was a bird in a small cage
And I was drunk on the radio waves
I was drunk, I was drunk on the radio waves

And all this time passed me by
And I was trapped in waiting
Sometimes the truth is hard to find
And I was scared of changing

What will it say
On my snow-covered grave?
"He had it all
He let it all just slip away"

Walked through the snow to a bar where there's no one I know
Drink slow, drink slow with nowhere to go
And when I leave I'll be singing this song
The summer's gone, carry on, I'm a ghost in the dawn

I was lost on the airplanes, I was high on the fast trains
My heart was a bird in a small cage
And I was drunk on the radio waves
I was drunk, I was drunk on the radio waves
