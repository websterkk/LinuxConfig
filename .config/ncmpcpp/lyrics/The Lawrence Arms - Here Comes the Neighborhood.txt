I work on Belmont, but I live in Wicker Park
All my friends are bartenders in all the coolest bars
My girlfriend's in the coolest band that you've ever seen
They play the Empty Bottle every week

I've got everything I need
My loft, my motorcycle, my hip restaurant down the street
And my neighbors are all artists or hot girls over 18
Who needs community when you live right in your scene?

From Jinx to Betty's Blue Star, everybody knows my name
From North Ave down to Augusta, everybody's all the same
It's a playground fueled by beer, no Chicagoans live here
It's a playground fueled by beer, no Chicagoans live here

It's geography bound tightly by big city dreams
It's geography bound tightly by big city dreams

And when the property value's raised
You'll be on your merry ways
Like the poor outclassed families before you
You've already paved Ashland to Western, Chicago to North Ave

Congratulations kids, your shallow model city
Is sinking, sinking down
Congratulations kids, your shallow model city
Is sinking, sinking down

You've become what you swore that you'd never be
