If Saturdays end sadder days
Pay stubs should bring salvation
Accelerating heartbeats happily
But these days our day jobs barely cover insurance
So now we can't afford our dreams
Skip town suddenly on half a heartbeat
And spark as sweetly as softly it came
Let the windows transition the night
So we don't miss a thing
Skip town suddenly cause New York doesn't look the same
You make it seem like Saturdays end sadder days
And it's OK to lie dead come the week
It's just like me to disagree
You make it seem like Fridays pay will make everything OK
It's just like me to plan an escape
Dead broke and happy and sitting in traffic again
We're down to one lane cause New York is never gonna change
But I can treat lungs black from bad decisions
Over another day of the same thing
Bad food, bad dreams, and Bad Religion
It's OK cause my way has only got to work for me
So tell me is it gonna get any easier
To find your way now that you've got a degree?
Cause there sure ain't any jobs for you here boy
And would you really want one anyway?
