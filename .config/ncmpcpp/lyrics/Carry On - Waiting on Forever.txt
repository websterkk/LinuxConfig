Inside you're dying
You can't face the shortcomings in your life
Looking for something to redirect the pain
I'm not sorry that you can't relate
But it's killing me to watch you act this way
And it's hard to see the way it used to be
When I'm wiping the spit off my face
We'll be here through the years
While you're so convinced we'll fall like the season
But give me one good reason...
Well it's nothing that I haven't heard before
But it's like comparing still water to rain
When it's your voice that carries the same old shit
I never thought we would end this way
What can I say
