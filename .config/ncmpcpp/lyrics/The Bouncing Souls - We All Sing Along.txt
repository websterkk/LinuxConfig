She was only seventeen, lost in the spaces in between
Looking for a place she could belong
He was a new face on the scene, another punk with his heart on his sleeve
He was gonna change the world with his song

But the world has its own ideas
We all must play the hand fate deals
When our plans have come and gone
We all share one heart song

We all sing along
We all sing along

Mrs. Jones cried herself to sleep, Valium and a bottle of gin to keep
Mrs. Jones' lonely body warm at night
Marriage ain't all she thought it would be, bought into the whole suburban fantasy
Everything was gonna be just right

But the world has its own ideas
We all must play the hand fate deals
When our plans have come and gone
We all share one heart song

We all sing along
We all sing along

When nothing turns out right, feels like a losing fight
Until we learn how to dance to that song
It's a symphony
And it goes on

An old man starts another day alone, a cardboard bed for his home
And feels the young ones stare behind his back
He sees himself in their pride, sees himself in their arrogant stride
He was gonna be a big CEO

But the world has its own ideas
We all must play the hand fate deals
When our plans have come and gone
We all sing one heart song

We all sing along
We all sing along
We all sing along
We all sing along

It goes on and on
It goes on and on
It goes on and on
It goes on and on

It goes on and on
It goes on and on
It goes on and on
It goes on and on
