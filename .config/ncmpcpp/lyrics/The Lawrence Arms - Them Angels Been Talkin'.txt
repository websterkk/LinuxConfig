What's that sound in the parking lot? Someone's getting sick
But the beards just gather round to snap another picture of his dick
Around the corner there's a party with a million pretty girls
Black and blue, tattooed and bruised, weary with the world

This hard life is running at full steam
Come on everyone and live the high life with me
I'm not gonna stop until the devil falls asleep
Tonight is the march of the meek

I feel the sparks on my teeth and in my veins
Summers spent in basements and smoking in the rain

Number fifteen and Anthony, when will I see you again?
When is the next time we can raise our voices with our friends?
If I promise just to love you, promise you'll always change
It's more than a blackout or remembering names

This hard life is running at full steam
Come on everyone and live the high life with me
I'm not gonna stop until the devil falls asleep
Tonight is the march of the meek

The ships and parades fade into dull grays
And everything ends way too soon
And up there the angels have been talking and you'd best believe what you always knew
Their words are all true, no one is waiting for you

This hard life is running at full steam
Come on everyone and live the high life with me
I'm not gonna stop until the devil falls asleep or Jesus gives me back my keys
Tonight is the march of the meek

Stand up and be counted
If you can't live without it
