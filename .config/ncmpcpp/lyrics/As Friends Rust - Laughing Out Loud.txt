Sometimes I'd like to know the insides of my wrists.
Sometimes I'd like to do what does not happen after this.
It's crazy, but it seems that I do nothing but let down.
I'm not doing any good.
The me you know is fraught with flaw,
And I bet you wish I would.
It's not crazy, it's just clear.
I do nothing but let down.
That another story for another time.
Another valid feeling you can undermine
Another crooked notch carved in your valentine.
I can hear you typing now (lol).
You're laughing out loud.
