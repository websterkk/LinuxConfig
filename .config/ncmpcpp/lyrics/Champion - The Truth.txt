I know the pain, I feel it too and it's tearing us apart
Can you take a breath, push it aside
And pick yourself back up?

You know that the choice to live your life
Lies in the palm of your hand

You've got the answers you need, just look inside yourself

So much at stake, can't waste our time chasing standards
We never set 
We know that the choice to live our lives 
Lies in the palms of our hands

And with the struggles faced just to make it through the day
Stepped out of line and found a better way
So much at stake and we can't let our lives pass us by
And the only ones we'll ever chase
Are the standards that we set

Now's the time to leave all our mistakes behind 
Because we've found the only truth we'll ever need
Every struggle faced and choices made will see us through
The words we've said, the promises kept
Is the only truth we need
