With nitroglycerine dripping off our chins
And elbows sliding off the bar,
We speak and breathe and charm our way
Under trains and between cars.
I'm drinking whatever you're buying
If you've got enough left to see it through
I say we soak ourselves to the bone.
I'm not going home unless it's with you.
Kickstart the night
And drown the world facedown in a loud song.
Let's start a fire
And let the scorned drink to things gone wrong.
We won't appreciate these days until they're all gone.
We never recognize what's right.
So here's to thing gone wrong.
I need some kind of savior to pull me from this seat.
From the people, from the smell, from the price, from the heat.
From the way they purchase hope with their last of change,
While they try to look different,
But they're all the same.
I got one more song left on the jukebox
And then I'm all yours.
I got two left feet so tired of standing,
Let's hit the door before we hit the floor.
Kickstart the night
And drown the world facedown in a loud song.
Let's start a fire
And let the scorned drink to things gone wrong.
We won't appreciate these days until they're all gone.
We never recognize what's right.
So here's to thing gone wrong.
I'm not going anywhere where they know me, anytime, anymore.
Sidestep the misspent souls from high school
I spent years learning to ignore.
And the masses of throbbing kids in tight t-shirts packed into this bar.
All praying for half an hour of romance
All half lucky they made it this far
So with a night two years in the making
And a half a mind to run as fast as I can,
Amidst a life spent going crazy.
Come and save me from inside my head
Kickstart the night
And drown the world facedown in a loud song.
Let's start a fire
And let the scorned drink to things gone wrong.
We won't appreciate these days until they're all gone.
We never recognize what's right.
So here's to thing gone wrong.
Kickstart the night
And drown the world facedown in a loud song.
Let's start a fire
And let the scorned drink to things gone wrong.
We won't appreciate these days until they're all gone.
We never recognize what's right.
