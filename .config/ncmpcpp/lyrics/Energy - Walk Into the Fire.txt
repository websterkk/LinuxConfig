Yeah
Hot steppa

I walk through the fire
Now I'm a hot steppa
Fire starter
Feel no pressure
I'm on my own level

I walk through the fire
Now I'm a hot steppa
Fire starter
Feel no pressure
I'm on my own level
I'm on my own level

Full fit Burberry ice white jewellery
Diamonds in her eyes
Look how she observing me
Hot steppa, yeah
Go getta, no pressure
Shirt tucked in like a professor
Oh yes I'm maneuvering
I do this thing
I'm cruising in
You lose, I win
That's how the game go
Uppercut her ribs
I know how to break bones
Imma take these hoes' soul on they way home
High flyer but I lay low
How she put it on me
How the fuck could I say no
I'm just watching now she swayin' slow
Energy capture the one look at her then it's case closed
Notorious like Conor
Do what I like when I wanna
Lipstick allover my collar, she a problem
I'm from England but I'm runnin' up all these dollars
I'm with the devil not with the hand of god
Like Maradona

I walk through the fire
Now I'm a hot steppa
Fire starter
Feel no pressure
I'm on my own level

I walk through the fire
Now I'm a hot steppa
Fire starter
Feel no pressure
I'm on my own level
I'm on my own level

Wasting my time, then we're over
I can easily act like I don't know you
Louis Vuitton Holdall on the cold shoulder
Maneuvering global
They jealous of me local
Keeping me moving, don't give a fuck about who knows
Shift the rooms' energy when I roll through
Ain't got no business doin' shit I ain't supposed to
No more gotta do
I be always on the move
Ohh
If you see me less, I'm doing more

Do a woman no wrong
I remember pretending that there was lava on the floor
Now there's bags of designer overflowing around the room
Man goes shopping now everything nearer
Cartier glasses, My vision got clearer
Sleep in the middle of the bed when I miss her
I feel my spirit leave my body when I kiss her

I walk through the fire
I'm a hot steppa
I'm a hot steppa

I walk through the fire
Now I'm a hot steppa
Fire starter
Feel no pressure
I'm on my own level

I walk through the fire
Now I'm a hot steppa
Fire starter
Feel no pressure
I'm on my own level
I'm on my own level
