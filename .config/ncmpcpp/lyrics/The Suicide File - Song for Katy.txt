It hurts sometimes to think about
How far away this is from what you'd hoped for.
The way things were supposed to stay.
And though you learned a lesson and you took it with grace,
I wish I could stop the cold hand of reality from hitting you in the face.
But there is no sparkling clean solution.
And shit isn't just gonna get resolved in a half an hour,
With special guest stars and pearls of wisdom.
So let's not kid ourselves here.
You and I were swindled by an image that was so tantalizing
And real that I could almost taste it.
But now the stench of failure is worse than anything.
It permeates everything I do.
And I'm starting to realize that I'd rather have nothing than have a lie,
And sitting waiting for a life that's already passed me by.
