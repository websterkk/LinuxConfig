All the things that we've come to love, all the lessons learned,
All the stories of a better life and a future that were never true.
I guess your plots and plans,
Your deceptions and lies were truths we never saw behind the fleeting disguise.
We're unmasking the hate and we're coming for you.
We're gonna kick it and push it, and pull it right back through.
And it's not for you.
When all that shit starts coming down its coming right back to you.
And I know just what to do,
And all that shit starts coming down right back to you.
I can't think of a better view or of another place where I'd rather be.
I can't wait to see the look on your face,
Now your time has come and there's no complaints.
We're picking up where you left off and keeping it true.
We're gonna kick it and push it, and pull it right back through.
Wrong time and wrong place,
And the situations out of your hands,
And now the tides are changing.
Our time has replaced them.
The situations part of our plan,
And now the ground is breaking.
