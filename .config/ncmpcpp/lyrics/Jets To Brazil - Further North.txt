The road tonight is cold with ice
And no cars pass by
Thank god for no phone calls
Just snow and a fire

December endings and since you sent me things
I just feel further north
This year took ten years to
Tell me that I'm alone again

Everything here's about to break
I'm one inch from more than I can take
And it's beautiful and sad but it's all that I have
So tonight let's stay inside

I'll be the husband with a book for the bride
Tonight let's stay inside

I could play guitar
I've got so many songs
That you've never heard, and they weren't about you
And I won't change a word just because you're gone

The trees creak with their arthritic arms
Brittle in their powdered bark
Blue moonlight, I can't cry right
But I miss you tonight

Everything here's about to break
I'm one inch from more than I can take
And it's beautiful and sad but it's all that I have
So tonight I'll stay inside

There are things that I'd like to try with you but
I'll stay inside
Tonight I'll stay inside
I could play guitar
