One nation of division and conformity.
Divided we stand, united we'll fall.
So where's this land of equal opportunity?
Divided we stand, united we'll fall.
Divided we stand, united we'll fall.
Divided we stand, united we'll fall.
Divided we stand, united we'll fall.
Divided we stand, united we'll fall.
