So you're fading kinda fast
Like the red brake lights rushing past

This more than waking up when you're still at the bar
Lurking around with the queens after dark
We've come a long way just to end up lost
We're drifting, yeah we're drifting, we're drifting alone, alone

Cut it up, cut it up
Until the pain goes away, until the pain goes away
Cut it up, cut it up, cut it up, cut it up
Until the pain goes away, until the pain goes away

Everything on the avenue's a little more gray
And everyone's wearing just a little decay
Cut it up, cut it up and hand it over
I don't want to remember

Everything on the avenue's a little more gray
And everyone's wearing just a little decay
Cut it up, cut it up and hand it over
I don't want to remember, I don't want to remember

Cut it up, cut it up
Until the pain goes away, until the pain goes away
Cut it up, cut it up, cut it up, cut it up
Until the pain goes away, until the pain goes away

When the ship done sinks and the crew done drowns
Where am I gonna do all my hanging around?
This cruise is ending, please hold onto your stub
Thank you for coming, and thanks for the love

Thanks for the love
Let's cut it up until the pain goes away
