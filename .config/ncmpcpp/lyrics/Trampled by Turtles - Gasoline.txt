You said my heart was broken
You're prettiest when you laugh
If you go out in this cold, hard world
Make sure you come back alive

Your mind was built of matchsticks
And your heart was gasoline
In the morning when the smoke come risin'
You're nowhere to be seen

Tomorrow's got nothing for me
Let the sun rise when it wants
I see the skies for day and night
I know it's my own damn fault
