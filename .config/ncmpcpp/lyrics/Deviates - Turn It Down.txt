And as soon as it came it was gone
Taking more than it gave, what else could we have done
False hope and our weakness lead us on and on and on

Comforted by a constant fear
We raise our voices, no one hears
We may lose, but we're not lost
Day by day we're making it through the nights

And so we sing "We are one, undivided, and we are here."
And so we scream "I am one, independent," but no one hears.
And so we sing all at once to different songs
I want to turn it down

And so it comes and goes, it serves us right
No surprise in your eyes that we're at it again
Urgency and a cheapness lead us on and on and on

It's too loud and we can't hear
The next to come will find us here
We may lose, but we're not lost
Day by day we're making it through the nights

And so we sing "We are one, undivided, and we are here."
And so we scream "I am one, independent," but no one hears.
And so we sing all at once to different songs
I want to turn it down

And so we sing "We are one, undivided, and we are here."
And so we scream "I am one, independent," but no one hears.
And so we sing all at once to different songs
I want to turn it down

And so we sing
I hear your voice, my ears are ringing
But I didn't catch what you said
I hear your voice, my ears are ringing
But I didn't catch what you said

And so we sing
I hear your voice, my ears are ringing
But I didn't catch what you said
I hear your voice, my ears are ringing
But I didn't catch what you said

And so we sing "We are one, undivided, and we are here."
And so we scream "I am one, independent," but no one hears.
And so we sing all at once to different songs
I want to turn it down

And so we sing "We are one, undivided, and we are here."
And so we scream "I am one, independent," but no one hears.
And so we sing all at once to different songs
I want to turn it down
