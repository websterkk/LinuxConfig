Home: Embrace the concept, can't afford the place. As the long knives of the night were keeping you awake, I called you up just to learn the rain stretched across the states, drowning the soft features of your face. for heaven's sake, it just goes to show: you can't hang out and just go to shows from your studio apartment hiding from the student loan department all alone. It just goes to show when we're on the road just going to shows I feel the long chains of space around our throats. But I miss you. And I'm coming home.
