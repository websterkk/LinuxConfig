Let those feelings go.

Because I let those feelings go from the inside,
And I still can't find a decent reason to be anywhere.

If I could fill this hole on the inside,
I would trade the Charles for the James so I wouldn't have to see the snow.

But it gets cold looking in from the outside.
It gets cold looking out on the world.
It gets cold looking in from the outside.
It gets cold looking out on the world.

It gets cold.

I spent a long time, sitting on the back porch thinking to myself, looking in from the outside.
Spent a long time looking for a place in my family, always looking in from the outside.

Spent a long time looking for the words, no matter what I say, I'm looking in from the outside.
I spent a long time wandering this world. And it gets cold.
