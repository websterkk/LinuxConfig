I'm sober like a Sunday morning mass.
Liars are lying to themselves.
I'm lost or I'm losing everything.
I'm wasted. I can't keep the night from falling down.

Don't recreate the scene,
Or reinvent the meanings.
'Cause all that shit, it means nothing.
You just take it as it comes
And let it all fade away.
And all those times you felt something,
But your heart was on the run.
So it goes, so it goes.

I'm lonely like a lazy weekend.
My feet never touch the ground.
I'm drunk or I'm drinking everything.
My face has blossomed like a flower now.

Don't recreate the scene,
Or reinvent the meanings.
'Cause all that shit, it means nothing.
We just take it as it comes
And let it all fade away.
And all those times you felt something,
But your heart was on the run.
So it goes, so it goes.

Somewhere along the way,
I lost my destination.
And then I ended up, yeah,
In a thousand different places.
The road is long tonight.
Maybe we'll be somewhere by morning.
We're never anywhere; we're either coming or going.

Yesterday means nothing to me.
We've gotta move on.
There is no other way.
Yesterday...is nothing but a dream to me.
