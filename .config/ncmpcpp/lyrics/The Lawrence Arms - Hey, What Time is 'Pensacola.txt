It's killing time
The tv's on
With a bottle of shit
Buried needle
The record player's
Forgotten not to spin
So, you're feeling useless
Well, the bidding starts
At $19.95
And while the survey says
'Cheers and applause'
Another hour dies
Jacking off again
40 oz in the fridge
Have these dreams put to sleep
So call me up
And tell me something
I'm dying to believe

I don't know
I don't care
I just sit and stare now
I don't think
I just listen to the drone of this old being

Friday night
Stepping out
And talking to the same
So, how's your family
How was school
Conversation strain
Force endurance
From this class
It's 11:45
Two more hours
Lumber past
And I feel like I tried
Fucking off again
Talking to this bitch
She hates me
I hate her
So shut me up
And take me somewhere
I'm dying to leave

I don't know
I don't care
I just sit and stare now
I don't think
I just listen to the drone of this machine
[x2]

I just listen to the voice of this machine
