When you've been pushed to the side
You feel kind of useless
It feels like somethings left inside
So do it right this time and leave that stuff behind
Stop thinking about it
You have to get away right now

So move your car (x3)
I think it's best for you right now
Move your car
You have to get on with your life
So do it now!

You don't deserve to feel this way
'Cause you're not a loser
You have to clear your mind and see
That it was not your fault and you're not the one to blame
You can put it away now
So take some time to change your life

I guess that's best for you to move that car
It will take some time
But in the end you'll find
That you are worth a better life than this
